B9MAfqhVw1AxNzwu2ELPtQ,certified hidden gem the horn has been a great addition to murfreesboro pike serving light somali fare and coffee it's ran by a beautiful family that has been blessing nashville with somali food for a long time i highly recommend getting their sambusas featured in this pic they are triangular pockets of deliciousness stuffed with a filling and fried it's located about 510 minutes from downtown depends on traffic on murfreesboro pike it's always very clean there and the family is super friendly not to mention the food and coffee is extremely affordable honestly i think they should charge more other coffee shops easily charge double for what they offer here this might not be your hipster's favorite spot to write a novel but it's a great place to catch up with a friend over great food and coffee,positive
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,very good food i recommend reservations two weddings slowed the service but the food was excellent seafood is the primary draw but limited beef and chicken dishes dress code was loose from sport coats to shorts,positive

vZlPeIEzNK2YkZhGcLxHOw,all i can say iswow if you like good food this is a definite try  it is small and family owned the service was excellent  everyone was greeted as they entered and exited like you where an invited guest we had never eaten african food before and the flavors are out of this world  we started with the hot tea and it was very flavorful  fresh mint fresh like right off a plant brought to your table was offered and graciously accepted not a mistake there everything we ordered was served on a pizza type plate with injera as the base and all the meats and vegetables in separate piles  there is also a side of cut injera used to eat with  utensils are optional here and unless you know exactly what you ordered and how its supposed to look you're just going to have to go with the flow  there was not one item on that plate that did not stimulate the taste buds if you have picky kids like i do the pasta and meat sauce is a good option don't hesitate if you are considering this place you won't be disappointed,positive
YDisPepPeWeELiVGycxOlw,only came for drinks but enjoyed our time here there is touchtunes which is nice but also felt too quiet when people weren't playing anything nice to have some music on in the background pretty good beer selection  including some draft options and lots of bottles i'd like to come back for food and maybe try one of the ethiopian beers,positive
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,once again because my son who is in love with the coconut rum wings we were back at whiskey joe's to further explore the menu  we started with the so addictive wings since hubby is out of town for business we decided to enjoy a little mom and son time with a good meal  i decided to order the strictly off the appetizer section on the menu because i notice a few eye catching dishes that caught my last time and i was was happy with both choices and my son ordered mac and cheese with grilled shrimp addedmy appetizer choices consisted of shrimp   sausage quesadilla and joe's rocking oysters the oysters were filled a great cornbread stuffing that was filled with corn andouille sausage crabmeat and pepper jack cheese i could barely taste the crab but the freshness of the oysters was excellent and the overall taste of the dish was delicious just wish i could of tasted a little more crab  the shrimp  sausage quesadilla was full of flavor and i would definitely order both appetizers again  my son was like mom this mac and cheese is great next time i want to add crab to it to kick it up another notch yes we watch food network together lo but seriously everytime we come to whiskeys joe's the service is great our food is fresh and we are never disappointed   we had an awesome time,positive
oYvjtszgXo5x45d6fa6y2g,this place was really different from any other place that i've eaten  i have minimal experience with african food only ethiopian eritrean and moroccan  this place was very different  the food we got here was fairly diversethe sauce item we ordered okra was saucy and stewlike and outstanding and the other item we got was a grilled shrim thing with grilled green peppers and raw onions that had been marinated in some kind of sauce  we had sides of plantain and couscous mixed with cassavai liked everything we hadportions here are very large  many of the items that cost around 812 could easily feed two people  we took a lot of food homeservice was also very good  i would heartily recommend this place especially for people who are interested in trying something genuinely new,positive
B9MAfqhVw1AxNzwu2ELPtQ,i've been going to this place for almost 3 years now best place to eat breakfast  have some relaxing time with a nice coffee the staff are very friendly you don't get to wait long to get what you need they have nice somali tea sombosa bahamri  gyro,positive
ziyXteCmNmRprs10buP2iQ,one of my favorite restaurants in philly and a definite must if you're looking for west african cuisine i've been to kilimanjaro a handful of times and have never been disappointed portions are big fresh and incredibly savory last i went i ordered the fish  whole  head bones and all and rice the fish was fried but can also be grilled with a delicious sauce and marinated onions the bf ordered senegalese chicken and couscous which came with stewed veggies we were stuffed beyond belief two orders is probably enough to feed 3 seriously do yourselves a favor and try this place out,positive
ziyXteCmNmRprs10buP2iQ,amazing food the staff is great the space is small and seating is limited so i've always done take out the make everything to order so it does take a while but definitely worth it,positive
lYMJ_lraMXqKPJycdD3_7Q,the menu offers a wide variety of mouthwatering african dishes as well as few african desserts being this was not my first time purchase from kings  queens and i had the opportunity to try various dishes as i enjoy every dish that i have try i especially love the achike and fish accompanied by a side of delicious golden ripe plantains fresh and well season vegetables as well as there authentic pepper sauce while my server was incredibly kind and accommodating  i appreciated timely manner of my food being deliver as a whole i truly enjoy my experience when ordering from king  queen african cuisine,positive

YY96Jfi26j5iF4aDICyRXg,after reading the reviews on here i took a leap of faith and visited the place once back in nov and again yesterday the reason for such a gap in visits since i live in missouri the owner will take the time out to answer any and all questions and the service is very personal they have made a few changes so the lunch buffet has been removed from the menu oh well but the portions off the menu are big enough for my greedy husband's appetite so this place gets five stars from me btw byob is not allowed but this is fine by me number change 2154542875,positive
VwADinB-DonoikE35VtkCA,my favorite food ever friendly staff and have never been disappointed my only wish is that they were a little more speedy getting to the tables and taking orders,positive

3sQehkDWhJVtYQ90MUMRNw,super clean very authenticly and beautifully decorated restaurant and an easy to find locationawesome the food is so delicious it's well seasoned and nicely presented,positive
TUCm1lCkh-usRYRl3U0S8w,another favorite of mine all the food is cooked perfectly and portions are generous one tray can easily feed at least 2 adults i usually order either lamb but my kids try everything so it's a family favorite definitely won't be disappointed and yes the customer service is great they're patient with answering questions and will even make accommodations if possible with no complaints best to go in to order though cause these food apps do them a disservice by not offering everything and the delivery is horrible,positive
S-VD26LE_LeJNx5nASk_pw,when i need an order of potato greens and rice or  fried fish with jollof rice this is my spot definitely worth the ride for my fix so far i can't find really good liberian food near me,positive
T6c7iPO8Y4t_GQiyevZbiQ,delicious and flavorful ethiopian food they have lots of options for both meat eaters and vegetarians generous portions and reasonable prices as well the owners are very kind too i highly recommend this restaurant if you've never tried ethiopian food before give it a try especially if you like flavorful cuisine,positive
nL7p1fol3N_2y_PrhiQNog,my kids and i enjoy eating here  the manager is a very nice guy  the wait staffinterestingly we've gotten our food either at different times or the wrong food the last several times we've been in  my daughter ordered the sirloin with 'mushrooms' on top that's an extra chargeonly they didn't come out  we had to ask three times and by the time they came we were all finished eating and there were literally about 3 tbsp of mushrooms  we never go when it's really busy so kind of comical when our order is still wrong often  having said that they're always quick to get us the right food and we love being able to shop there too  i would love to give cracker barrel five stars but just can't because they consistently mess our order up  i always tip the wait staff anyway because i see how much running around they have to do  they probably need a better system though for making sure the right foods come out when they're supposed to  another example i always order both sides to be the turnip greens and ask or vinegar on the side the vinegar never comes out with the food  five yearsevery cracker barrel i've gone to love that vinegar,positive
QUyLaPjsoZiRJ-RUBVa5rA,ordered takeout for yelp's big night in during this crazy time of quarantine what a great addition to st pete and the grand central district we have on our hands with the floribbean my wife and i both ordered separate bowls with different combinations as well as the guac and chips for first timers at floribbean i think it speaks highly of any buildyourown establishment if you can't go wrong with what bases you pick and how they complement each other in my bowl the braised beef although a little salty for my taste combined with the corn salsa which had a perfect amount of spice the brown rice and finally the curtido slaw to cool off the plate worked in perfect harmony it didn't leave me wishing i had any different combination to top things off the guac was uniquely it's own style and the chips were well made we will definitely be returning to the floribbean and look forward to when we can have a more traditional experience,positive
vZlPeIEzNK2YkZhGcLxHOw,i resisted going to this restaurant because i had been to the ethiopian restaurants in town and was not ever in a hurry to go back  their food was good but it didn't hit that crave point  it just wasn't my first choice  my friend however really wanted to try queen sheba  so i finally went  i am so glad i did  for some reason the flavor profiles were a home run we order the meat combo veggie combo and gaat the spicy lamb spicy beef chicken cabbage and lentils we all so good my friend love the gaat  we actually ordered 2 meals to go because i wanted more  i can't wait to return,positive
YDisPepPeWeELiVGycxOlw,what a great bar delicious food and service was fast and friendly the bar has a backyard patio where smoking is permitted it is one of the best in west philly,positive
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,i'm rating this 4 based on the gorgeous viewand the best wings i've had ever maybe they were having a good day but the fried garlic parmesan wings with ranch were the most delicious juicy crispy flavorful wings i've everrrrrrr had damn 14 is suuuuuper pricey but the wings were so good i'd go back and pay for more calamari was bleh,positive
utnjyv9GtUTnMumSduifpg,great place for ethiopian food and very friendly staff my favorite is the beef tibs the vegetable platter is yummy as well,positive
kWFgllI8AfMCIvRJ2KwuRA,i've had port of peri peri on my bookmarks of saved spots to try for a while and i finally stopped in today with co worker the interior is nicely decorated and has a rustic vibe with modern touches only one employee was working today and it was very quiet i ordered the chicken and rice bowl medium and a side of the cassava fries after reading multiple rave reviews here we sat inside while our food was prepared the chicken rice bowl was a very generous serving as were the fries the medium was pretty spicy but also had a ton of flavor the fries were good too very crispy and crunchy the garlic sauce was excellent and made a good cooling sauce when the heat was getting to me i brought half of my rice bowl home to eat for lunch tomorrow since it was so much food i wanted to eat it all right then but i'm trying to exercise some self control  yum,positive
8oqvWI5Lq-9dO2zejyuvjw,st louis is limited on african restaurants of which most are ethiopian  tam tam is one of the few that serves a delicious sample of east and west african food  the restaurant itself is nothing fancy it's a simple place located in a strip mall and the service can be somewhat slow but it's well worth the wait  for me it adds to the authenticity of the place and reminds me of a typical restaurant in africaon my most recent visit i was pleasantly surprised to be served a complementary basket of fried chapati strips with an african style salsa chapati is basically similar to a flower tortilla it's actually indian in origin but made its way to east africa with the indian people who have influenced the cuisine over the years i have fond memories of waking up to the smell of fresh chapati being grilled on the streets of kampala uganda  tam tam's deep fried version is very tasty and served with a bowl of salsa like sauce which included onions tomatoes green peppers and mild spices  the sauce is excellent and perfect with the warm chapati chips  i've tried three main courses here and all have been very good my favorite would probably be the nyama choma goat meat nyama choma is grilled seasoned meat like bbq grill and very common in kenya tanzania and uganda tam tam's goat meat might just be the best i've ever eaten and i've eaten a lot of nyama choma over the years if you want to try goat meat keep in mind that it tends to be very chewy filled with fat and bones you often get little bone chips mixed in so be careful and also don't be disappointed when you're not served a nice big fillet of meat  i was amazed by the tenderness of this juicy and well seasoned meat  for 1299 you also get a side of fries plantains or couscous i chose the plantains which were the sweet ripe version cooked perfectlya majority of the main dishes on the menu are west african dishes which in general tent to be more spicy heatwise than east african food however from what i've tried nothing was overly spicyhot here at tam tam the poisson a la braisse or grilled tilapia fish comes whole and smothered in a chopped onion salsa type sauce 1199 the yassa guinaar for 850 is chicken marinated in garlic mustard and lemon which is cooked in an onion sauce  for the true west african experience you might want to try the fufu this dough like starch doesn't have much taste but is good for dishes with a lot of saucethe service has always been friendly but not overly aggressive  on my most recent visit the waiter was from kenya so i was happy to hear about the newere east african dishes that had been added to the menu  i only wish this place was closer to downtown then i'd be a regular  i'm giving this place 5 stars for tasty goat meat and an authentic taste of africa right here in st louis,positive
QUyLaPjsoZiRJ-RUBVa5rA,where do i start   food was great the flavors where unbelievably good  owner was very gracious and accomadating  definitely will visit again when i'm in town,positive
MoepRQ_fkTbX3HyxfQJMUg,i was traveling for work for 2 nights and had to find food for 2 dinnersi came here twice the first night was a weds when i didn't really understand that they only had jamaican food there wasn't a menu for the jamaican food i was just told what was available and i ordered from that i ordered the jerk chicken which came with beans and rice cabbage and a sauce initially i was a little bummed because i had been craving eritreanethiopian food but when i finally ate it in my hotel room it was the seriously the best jerk chicken i had ever had and i ate it when i wasn't even very hungry so it must have been good of course i had to go back the following night so that i could try the eritreanethiopian food i ordered the alicha beggee with the side of collard greens it was delicious i can't speak to the ambiance since i went both times to get takeout too early for dinner the staff were nice and the food was delicious i'll definitely be back,positive
DdryIpjFlALA-7Dtmp9d2A,what a great place to experience different and delicious food  kibroms was a delightful treat  will be beach soon to see them as well as the other entrepreneurs in the boise international market,positive
T6c7iPO8Y4t_GQiyevZbiQ,best ethiopian food i've had i absolutely love ethiopian food and finally convinced my brother mother and father to come with me and satisfy my pregnancy cravings  we enjoyed chicken sambusas buticha garlic chick pea dip chicken tibbs beef tibbs and lamb tibbs with a variety of veggies i wish we would have taken a picture but we completely cleaned the plates literally my brother enjoyed the st peter's beer which he thoroughly enjoyed while my parents and i had the lemonade and ice tea the lemonade was carbonated with a ginger flavor and it was delicious after dinner we ordered the coffee which is freshly grinded and brewed it was amazing my brother took his with 2 teaspoons of sugar and i took mine with 3 no creamer i wish i could have it every morning  our server i believe she owns the restaurant was very nice welcoming and informative even though she sensed i knew my ethiopian food cannot wait to return with more family members and enjoy more food,positive
VwADinB-DonoikE35VtkCA,like the concept of the samplers makes a crowd favorite absolute a fan of the fermented bread kinda sour but add a refreshment to all the spices,positive
S-VD26LE_LeJNx5nASk_pw,the best african food i've ever tasted i refuse to go else where other places let me down,positive
PXQGiGwBqfFuO81BFB3LHg,as a foodie every once in a while you stumble upon a culinary gem sometimes off the beaten path i am no stranger to ethnic food however there are not many options within and around indy for the more exotic types of cuisine such as african food the first type of african food i discovered was nigerian back around the y2k hype at the transition into the 21st century i vividly recall eating very tasty greens sautéed in onions and tomato sauce with meat and chicken and goat and very tasty and colorful rice and other starchy based dishes such as fufu and amala as a lover of spice and exotic food i indulged in all the spices herbs and unique favors i'd been missing for almost a decade when i by chance learned of beautful shades aka naira land the owner and chef david is very friendly and eager to answer any question you may have regarding the unfamiliar to many typical nigerian dishes i ate the efo mildly spicy greens sautéed in tomato sauce with beef and fish and herbs lightly fried chicken with no batter added to it and beans served with a delicious sauce on top and dodo lightly fried plantains the price of such very tasty food is very affordable besides some main dishes and specials you can create your own meal by ordering side items plus meat the meal that i usually create cost around 937 including tax but excluding a drink oh and regarding the interior the restaurant is simple yet clean and not too long or wide there's enough room for about a party of under 50 in the main restaurant area there are two wall mounted flat screens and a sink to wash your hands before you indulge in some of the finger food based meals like fufu pounded yam or amala  a similar yet wheat based starchy pounded substance upon which sauces with meat are served so if you like ethnic food and you've never had african food before this is the perfect place for you to discover some of the best west african food you can find in indy be bold and adventurous and add a new restaurant to your list of ethnic food gems,positive
k1yDRDZ4QCvNW9Wm9-IOaA,this place was great  it was very cute and we had no trouble getting a table around 8830  it was one of the few places with vegetarian items on the menu  i had the eggplant curry with couscous and my gf had the vegetarian jambalaya  hers came with the most delicious spinach  i would definitely have eaten there again if time had allowed,positive
kWFgllI8AfMCIvRJ2KwuRA,been waiting for this great food great ownership and best of all it's 100 halal certified win win,positive
Uj3a0BpXSEXmU3n6W8jcKg,as many others have said the decor  or lack thereof  is kind of laughable  it looks like a large room in a convention center which has been set up for a wedding reception  couldn't they have at least hung a picture or two on the walls after all this time  and the zumba class next door provided the music competing with the tv set hanging in the corner  why do so many places insist on having a tv on all the time  yes i am removing one star for the decor when i know i go to jiallo's for the food but giving some attention to the physical environment should mean something  i wasn't stopping by for takeoutbut i would  the food is absolutely delicious  we both had the jerk chicken because we felt we had to and oh wow is it good  the jamaican style jerk carryout place at 34th and keystone makes delicious jerk chicken but the jerk chicken at jiallo's seems slightly spicier which is great  the accompanying rice and beans was also delicious as was the plantain  and the servings are huge  mine definitely made two hearty meals  you can order the lunch portion even for dinner but they're only a couple of dollars less than the dinner portions  everything on the menu looked delicious and although only two other tables were occupied while we were there on monday night the other dishes appeared to be yummy  lastly the owner stopped by several times to check on us and to refill our drinks  very friendly service  i will be backthe hot stuff they serve along with the chicken    um it's really hot,positive
SoqgkE4zQ0KV0jRgMNA6TQ,best jamaican food in the bay area great portion sizes always fresh and always friendly,positive
Aelkw-nyg9I8aQM9mK_yhw,i'm not african so i couldn't tell you whether the food is authentic or not but all i can say is that it was extremely tasty  i had the palaver sauce with rice and it was delicious  the only reason for four stars as opposed to five is that they were out of a lot of things on the menu  but it satisfied my fix for african food which i absolutely love,positive
vZlPeIEzNK2YkZhGcLxHOw,this cute micro business has good food it's eritrean which is from the northeastern part of africa adjacent to ethiopia it's in the menu it seems popular for takeout but the restaurant was otherwise not busy at all for dining in i ordered a veggie and meat combo platter which is not officially on the menu but i didn't want to chose only one or the other it was so delicious to have all the savory flavors to taste i started eating with the bread to pick up the food but used a fork in the end the most notable dishes were the spinach potatoes spicy chicken and lentils so those i totally finished i also had the 'sweet bread' which is just actually like a plain focaccia the service is very relaxed like in many cultures around the world it was great to eat at the tables outside and talk for a couple of hours,positive
MoepRQ_fkTbX3HyxfQJMUg,there were three of us for dinner and the owner made a large tray for us of vegetables  chicken and beef  the vegetables were collards cabbage with carrots and potato spinach and red lentils  what a spread  the food was delicious and the presentation gorgeous  the serving sizes were very generous  this is worth going to even for carry out  the owner was very nice and helpful  i would definitely come back and the prices were very reasonable,positive
Aqsc1lA8-PN8YNMgroyeSg,i had the fufu and egusi and it was my very first time trying the dish so it's my first impression i don't have any other experience to compare it to but it was delicious and spicy the chicken was a bit tough but that was minor the flavors were great a generous amount of food as well i could barely finish it all as the fufu is very filling would def try other dishes from here soon,positive
_cbNtNu9SU_l-rb6HP27qg,just days after being saddened about the closing of the cool springs calypso cafe i discovered humdingers i only found out about this place because i was searching yelp for ethiopian cuisine and humdingers appeared in the results although not true ethiopian cuisine this restaurant is inspired by chilis and spices from the southern african countries including southern ethiopia they have a variety of piri piri sauces herehumdingers offers a variety of fish and chicken plates sandwiches and tacos most of the menu items are healthy and they offer a variety of healthy sides i had the blackened rainbow trout and my husband the blackened mahi mahi you can choose a topping and we both had the pineapple salsa which was great the plates were served with seasoned yellow rice and another side of your choice i opted for a side salad today but they have some other great items such as grilled zucchini asparagus and sweet potato slicesthe place is clean and nicely furnished you walk up and order and the staff brings your food out to your table as everything is made to order everything was fresh hot and delicious the blackened seasoning was good and the remoulade sauce served with the plates was really spicy which i liked they had four different piri piri sauces which i didn't even try because the food was so good without any further sauces the service was attentive and friendly and staff came around to the table asking if everything was satisfactorywe will definitely return,positive
ziyXteCmNmRprs10buP2iQ,i visited last evening after a recommendation by friend and reading the very good reviews  i've always loved senegalese foodpeopleculture  i love this restaurantsmall authentic wolof vibes playing popular contemporary west afri sounds  the servers were pleasant and listened well  being vegetarian they were more than accommodating  i was stuffed at end of meal  the friend with me was stuffed too this will definitely be a restaurant that i will visit again for the food people and vibes,positive
YDisPepPeWeELiVGycxOlw,one of my favorite neighborhood bars with great food and hospitality this is a great place on any day of the week friday through sunday attracts a larger and very mixed crowd there is a dj who spins caribbean american and afro beats music it turns into a big dance party which is fun to join in or if you're shy just sit back and watch drinks are affordable as well as the food great place to hang out with friends,positive
UQ9zn4jcjkTDOw0OwIOaxQ,in boise visiting family this was recommed by my niece the people were so nice and the food was amazing the combination dinners are smart because it lets you try different items no utensils you eat with the bread i had lamb and red lentils one of my daughters ordered 5 items to try different things we shared some  excellent i would highly recommend this place,positive
m0t-vuBHQOfC1ldTF6Dy7w,dropped in for the lunch buffet on a whim it was a great choicethe food was delicious the proprietors very friendly and welcoming and the service excellent the fried rice and the chicken curry were highlights of the meali'd never had ugandan food before it seems to be a real melting pot of african european middle eastern and indian influencesdo yourself a favor and check this place out,positive
DdryIpjFlALA-7Dtmp9d2A,i'm so happy boise finally has an ethiopian restaurant  the injera is delicious and all of the dishes i've tried so far have been very tastythe boise international market it's located in has a slightly under construction feel to it as they are still moving new shops and restaurants in  i imagine that will improve with time and isn't really an impediment to enjoying the awesome food anyway,positive
cIzp7QZOaUyRLl3ZcwsrHw,came in for to go order and the service was amazing the mini store has incense coffee and seasoning we loved the customer service and we haven't even tried the food make sure you come in support black business make a reservation and wear a mask,positive
kWFgllI8AfMCIvRJ2KwuRA,for chicken lovers who's looking for an alternative to the typical fried chicken mealcombo this would be an excellent choice especially if you like spicy flavor kinda reminds me of eating at kenny rogers roasters but with a twist having the roasted chicken and even the sides with that africanportugese flair if youre not into spicy food you can get it in mild and also dousing it with their creamy garlic sauce helps a bunch the wife swears the veggie pita was delicious price is not too shabby and the place looks nice spacious and bright with a modern industrial feel to it parking shouldnt be an issue either definitely seeing ourselves coming back,positive
-kYESienondGaj9TFadkUg,i've only ordered take out from here and i'm hoping that most of their customers do the same  i say that because i never see this place busy but i want them to do well to date i've ordered the lamb tibs beef tibs they were out of lamb that day chicken tibs and chicken doro wat  i find the flavors to be superior to that of neighboring ethiopian restaurants  actually i dare say it's the best one of the many i've tried  my only complaint is that the while the doro wat is tasty the one drumstick and an egg was a bit unsatisfactory  i think adding a thigh would bring the meal to perfect for me  the doro wat sauce does have a nice buttery flavor that i could just eat with injera thus saving the dish  the other tibs are very good flavor and portion like everyone says the ambiance is boring but if you have some wine and good company that will liven things up for you i'm sure  if you order for pickup they tend to say 2025 minutes but i give them at least 40 minutes so i don't end up sitting around waiting  i do of course have the advantage of living within walking distance though,positive
S-VD26LE_LeJNx5nASk_pw,hands downtheee best i've eaten here several times and i have never once been disappointed the portion sizes are amazingdefinitely large enough to share with another person food is always seasoned and cooked perfectly i typically order the fried or grilled fish tilipia or red snapper jolloff rice fried spinach or fried cabbage and cassava leaf  rice i am quite picky so if i'm a fanit's the real deal the pictures simply don't do it justice,positive
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,a reservation is highly recommended for their sunday brunch  we were able to sit at the bar as a walkin  you can have a perfect ocean view if you sit at the end of the bar  sunday brunch includes hors d'oeuvres omelet station waffles seafood crab oysters and shrimp mini desserts etc  smoked salmon and customized omelets are good  mahi was very dry and not tasty unfortunately  crab is okay quality  you can ask for butter since they don't have it out  definitely try their banana foster with vanilla ice cream over waffle  the waffles are so crispy  the brunch also includes soft drinks mimosa and vodka items  the bill was 68 with tax for two  if you love to drink you can get your money worth  since i am not a big drinker i tried to get my money worth by eating crab lol  bartender jonathan was great  he was very attentive and went an extra mile for us  it was a pleasant and relaxing experience with fantastic view and service,positive
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,signature margaritas are good alligator bites were tasty the ambiance of relaxing beachside while listening to their band was even better i'll def visit again,positive
mk4ecpQJPPLGnTykDWM38w,i loved the staff very friendly and it has a family feel they just opened but are off to a great start the food is so good you must be open to different ethnic spices i am bringing back my wife,positive
cIzp7QZOaUyRLl3ZcwsrHw,this was my first time tasting ethiopian cuisine so truthfully i have nothing to compare it to however the flavors were delicious and the proteins were cooked perfectly we had a whole fish that was delicious as well as some short ribs that were like tiny meat candy fantastic,positive
YEQk2NZM5TKqyqgo1rjFsg,nice place to hang out for a team experience  building exercise  decent food  cold beer  could definitely use a better selection of alcohol and tequila but the bowling lanes were fun and the food was good  atmosphere is setup to make it what you want and the crowd on a monday night was perfect  nice job  need some suavecito,positive
k1yDRDZ4QCvNW9Wm9-IOaA,you will never have spinach or plantains like they prepare there the black eye peas omg the clue is walking in the smell makes your mouth water as soon as you step in,positive
oYvjtszgXo5x45d6fa6y2g,i have been to this place dozens of times in the past two years it is definitely my favorite comfort food place to get takeout from in west philly the food is phenomenal at a great price i've had the pleasure of trying a few of their dishes but the two i keep going back to are the grilled lamb and the grilled chicken dibi viande and dibi poulet if you're looking for delicious succulent wellseasoned meat this is your place the senagalese onion sauce they cover the meat with is incredible and adds that extra bit of flavor i generally come in for dinner so i have yet to try their lunch specials but as you get at least 2 meals worth of meat and sides for 10 i don't even feel the need to try one general criticism i would give is that they sometimes overcook their meat so i usually just ask them to cook it less than they would otherwisetheir fresh ginger and hibiscus juices are also great but be warned they are extremely strong and sweet i prefer to dilute mineall in all a great place to eat the place is kind of shabby but as i go there for the food and not for the decorations it doesn't bother me,positive
dA6ArvvZYNS7NUQ1_v7ngA,amazing amazing i don't know how else to say it don't be discouraged by the market which on my recent visit wasn't stocked with very much head straight to the back eye over their simple menu and prepare to feast on food i have yet to find anywhere else in tucson i could try to describe it but i suggest going to eat it yourself i split the chicken kabobs and soup with a friend today and had a sambusa sort of like a samosa for dessert  everything was delicious great flavor fresh tasting and i didn't feel like i was eating too much even though it was a lot of food and all of it for only 1300 it was a steal i don't usually review a place after i've only been there once but listening to rave reviews from the friend i was with i'm certain this place is firing on all cylinders all the time seriously so goodknow before you go it's nothing special white and blue walls cafeteria style tables and chairsbut trust me your plate will arrive and it won't matter where you're sitting or what you're sitting on get over that and eat,positive
MoepRQ_fkTbX3HyxfQJMUg,don't be mistaken by the empty restaurant the food was incredible and extremely reasonably priced the guy who works in the kitchen has kind eyes and delivers a small heaven on a plate the serving portions are massive and will definitely having me coming backbe prepared for slower service and more laid back dining experience it's very casual during the day but looks like it sometimes turns into a more hopping bar at night highly recommend ordering the sambusas as you wait,positive
VwADinB-DonoikE35VtkCA,for lovers of the original zemam's there is one major reason to try zemam's too at least once you can choose the gored gored as part of the sampler platter i'd always been curious about it but i just couldn't abandon my beloved sampler platter it's so good anything on the menu is fair game for the sampler including some fish and lamb options which you won't find at the og zemam'sfor the uninitiated zemam's too is a great restaurant for people who 1 love bold flavors and spice 2 are open to an interesting nonwestern dining experience and 3 aren't too fussy about ambiance or getting their hands dirty like its predecessor zemam's too is now in the top tier of my favorite restaurants in tucson i prefer these restaurants over cafe destathe zemam's dishes really hit you with flavor like a truck which i absolutely love,positive
ziyXteCmNmRprs10buP2iQ,i love this palace since the first time i ate there i have been wanting the dibi chicken every week now i love the onion sauce all on top of my dish now i always ask for extra never loved the taste of onions so much it has a tangy but sweet flavor to it i always recommend this dish to everyoneand the jolof pronounced rice has a spicy taste to it with very little mixed  vegetables and my preferred drink is the ginger juice my husband has ordered fish from there and liked it but when he ordered the dibi chicken he's never ordered anything else after that over all its a very small restaurant and the negative is they do not have high chairs for children so definitely keep that in mind if they have a crowd your best bet is to order outprices varies depending on what your ordering and they do not take credit cards another reminder cash only,positive
0GQ1O0vmmLiHWB0y1JM-zg,now five guys burgers and fries on the other hand is a winwin situation the help is always cheerful and attentive and the food is excellent it is worth every penny and i always leave their restaurant feeling full and satisfied if i had to leave a tip for you i would say order the small order of french fries it comes in a huge paper sack filled with golden crisp french fries seasoned to perfection and if you're feeling a little edgy try sprinkling a little malted vinegar on top of them omg i'm not sure that there is anything five guys could do to be a better dining experience i've read some of the other reviews and yes five guys is a little pricey for their burgers and fries but if you're going out to eat you're going to spend some dough anyways why not treat yourself to a great burger an awesome fries and have a few laughs while you're at it,positive
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,we made it tradition to come here before or after our flight to enjoy the amazing views and refreshing mojitos our server jamie k was super sweet welcoming and accommodating,positive
3sQehkDWhJVtYQ90MUMRNw,absolutely fantastic i spend a lot of time on the east coast and of all the ethiopian restaurants i've tried a shameful amount really somehow this little ethiopian restaurant in reno is the one that has my heart my favorite dishes are the alichia mild beef stew tilkil gomen cabbage  carrots and the green bean dish plus try the ethiopian tea it tastes like cardamom easy parking lots of seating and an excellent staff,positive
A0-S0UG8P00_T5RavArH3g,loved loved the food excellent personal customer service from the owner i was eating at this place almost all the 5 days i was in tucson customized goat meat recipe i loved the okra sauce with fish  chicken and fufuthe ginger and hibiscus drinks were highly refreshingi wish you the very best and thank you for warm hospitality,positive
cIzp7QZOaUyRLl3ZcwsrHw,this is some of the best ethiopian food we've ever eaten  we ordered the veggie combo with a side of the cheese and the fish wot with a side of shiro  everything was so flavorful and we had enough food left to take it home and eat a second meal  everyone working here was very friendly and helpfulthere are some outdoor picnic tables which are nice and shaded  the traffic is a bit noisy because of the location on broad but we wer happy to have an outdoor option nonetheless  the inside is adorable and we look forward to dining here again very soon,positive
9wTSBQFqVWbq-NEikPAs_g,wow just wow it's so hard to find west african restaurants so imagine my excitement when i saw fudena listed as a must try popup in a few articles online my husband is ghanaian and we're always on the lookout for jollof rice it's one of my favorite meals we're visiting from california and we've tried a handful of west african restaurantsfood trucks out there and haven't been impresseduntil now this is as close as it's gotten to his mom'ssister'sauntie'schurch's cooking highly highly recommend the jollof complex it was the highlight of the meal we've never paired greens with jollofchicken but i might have to start because they are on to something not pictured is the tomato stew on the side which was delicious definitely get the tomato stew spicy it wasn't too hot albeit we have a high tolerance for spice love the fastcasual and popup concept if you've been curious about ghanaian or west african food this is the perfect way to get introduced to it ,positive
frsWe9bmMOMIBOBNzsCTew,the food is definitely good no question about that they make tilapia like no other place i know the only down size is that the place gets too crowded on friday nights and the waiters get rude i'd recommend it for a weekday or early weekend,positive
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,we went here for our 9 yr wedding anniversary the views are beautiful the food was very good the service was great,positive
cIzp7QZOaUyRLl3ZcwsrHw,doro wat you do but watch my shoeshey y'all black lives still matter and police are still out there brutalizing peoplei hope you're all doing your part in the revolution it takes work and work needs fuelso i decided to head in over to addis last friday to check it out it's been on my list pretty much since it opened i've been slacking y'allprince was there to help us make some delicious choices we started with sambusa not pictured one collared green one meat they were so flaky and flavorfulfor the entree doro wat traditional ethiopian stewcurry and shrimp tibs like a stir frystew mashup oh  my  goodness y'all the flavor  the shrimp tibs were popping with lime and chilies the doro wat stole the whole show the after party and the lobby though seriously take it to the bank because it's money honey  my mouth is watering just thinking about it right now it was rich flavorful earthy and just down right deliciousthis was my first time eating ethiopian food ever if you haven't went i'll tell you now you eat with your hands there is no cutlery fine by me i used to eat with my hands sitting on a dastarkhān when i was young so honestly it felt normal to me for those of you who are unfamiliar the food is served on top of injera a type of flatbread or with rice but also with injera on the side just like pita or naan you used it to pick up your food the injera under the food is soaked in the juices though so i highly recommend using it to get all those flavorsi will definitely be back with more friends next time and probably grabbing takeout too this spot is straight,positive
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,everything about the rusty pelican was spectacular we had a reservation for our anniversary and our waiter tj was attentive and so nice the gm came to the table multiple times to check in on us can't recommend the rusty pelican enough,positive
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,i visited this past weekend for brunch and was treated to one of the best meals i have had in years i had the unlimited mimosas with the chicken and waffles it was so good the chicken was some of the most tender and delicious fried chicken i've ever had and the waffles had this unique orange cinnamon taste to them my girlfriend had the french toast sticks and they were wonderful as well overall this was a fantastic place and i highly recommend it,positive
k1yDRDZ4QCvNW9Wm9-IOaA,delicious food  lunch is cheap and seems to be africanized versions of new orleans food think african jambalaya  dinner is seems less new orleansish  it's about 1015plate and everything i tried was delicious  if you go make sure to get the fritters,positive
Cwz2B0bXZXwCZ6Ru9-P6UA,just what i needed some oxtails rice and peas and cabbage the food was flavorful and came out hot they accept cash and card and the prices were extremely reasonable based on the price and quality of food i would 100 go back again,positive
K0Cw8KXgF23sEji9TnfBkA,wonderful meal started with the parker house rolls and parisienne gnocchi both were delicious gnocchi is not an entree 4 people at our table and roll and gnocchi were enough for all to share  swordfish lamb ragu and steak were dinners choices and everyone enjoyed their meal they truly were all great meals  we ordered all the desserts and the sundae and coconut cake were the favorites  great service from aaron we were there for an anniversary celebration and would definitely go back,positive
UQ9zn4jcjkTDOw0OwIOaxQ,unbelievable find their food is insanely good get a combo plate and load it up because everything is delicious service was great food arrived very quickly we'll definitely be back again,positive
ziyXteCmNmRprs10buP2iQ,the food here is really one of a kind especially for someone who did not have a lot of african food style foodthe shrimp appetizer is great for most dishes the way the meat is cooked and served gives you a feeling of the african wilderness the poissonfish and poultry are chargrill as a full body and tastes amazingtheir african style juice is also very special and highly recommended one star off for the service though i requested ketchup three times and the waitress obviously too busy managing the whole place forgets my sauce every single time,positive
UQ9zn4jcjkTDOw0OwIOaxQ,for many occasions the rest of my family love this place but i remained apprehensive so i decided to go try them and even offered to payjust to get me out of the house kibrom's is a small place i ordered the beef side a lamb side and vegetable lentils their description of this weird thin bread was exactly that weird but after beginning to eat my meal the rest of the family ordered a larger tray i started to enjoy coming the trays of food were the sizes of large pizza tims full of food the idea is to rip off some bread and sop up you food without using silverware i inhaled my glass of water and probably due cultural differings i never saw anybody pouring more water it wasn't a big deal because my wife gave me her water and i kept eating until my tray was bone clean so was theirs'we will definitely return my wife wants to visit their kitchen to learn how they bake that bread,positive
UQ9zn4jcjkTDOw0OwIOaxQ,economical easy and delicious  this place may not be the shiniest remodeled restaurant in boise nor the cleanest and most efficient but its healthy yummy and very affordable  this is one of my goto spots in boise madhuban is also a fave  if you havent been here and are looking for a no frills cheap meal then give it a shot  east african soul food  yes please,positive
vZlPeIEzNK2YkZhGcLxHOw,wow this food is great full of flavor and spices i got the vegetarian combo and it came with eight different dishes the teff pancake is so fun to eat with my favorite was the ga'at yet liked it all the food was served quickly and feels like high vibration the staff is kind and smiles often very welcoming i am grateful if i lived in tucson i'd eat here,positive
8oqvWI5Lq-9dO2zejyuvjw,we finally got to try out tam tam last night there are not a lot of african  non ethiopian  restaurants in saint louis so we had been waiting to try it out for a while we were further encouraged by a restaurantcom gift certificate we got there around 930pm and we were worried the kitchen might be limited but we were very pleasantly surprised in fact they are open for dinner on the weekends till 1030pm our server frankie was attentive and came to check on us several times she gave us options for the few things that were not available on the menu that day we got the samosas and couscous for appetizers and the curry lamb with ugali and goat steak with plantains for our main entrees prices were great ranging between 79 for the entrees which were generous portions and everything came with multiple sidesthe beef samosas were hot and piping and as we were hungry they disappeared immediately the lamb curry was delicious with cassava and carrots and came with a side of greens and ugali the lamb was soft and tender and you can dip the ugali in the curry sauce the goat steak was served on a bed of coleslaw with plantains the spices on the steak were delicious  described on the menu as ''the african way'' we ordered the ginger drink which was sweet with a great kick and a mixed african whiskey cocktail be careful they make their drinks strong overall excellent service great prices and we can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu,positive
A5Fe8z2nA_FoQ6grZq2RZQ,wanted to try something different so my best friend and i found out there was a west african restaurant near where we were the restaurant is in a plaza in the middle of a florissant neighborhood very quiet there isn't a ton of seating so we were happy about that covid concerns we did end up eating in the music was great the service was nice and the food was really good the wait was about 1520mins because everything is made to order,positive
A5Fe8z2nA_FoQ6grZq2RZQ,worth a try if you've never had african fooddue to the seasoning fried rice here is different than its chinese counterpart and possibly even tastier since the small veggie fried rice was such a good value i opted to add beef that was a mistake the rice was fine by itself but the beef chunks were chewy and gave my jaws a workout for adding the beef i nearly doubled the meal price after that it didn't seem such a good value the tomato purée served on the side was very much a tasty homemade marinara sauce that added to the dish staff was friendly and helpful the indoor space is small making social distancing challenging with more than two parties and includes bar tables and stools as well as regular seating,positive
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,my friend and i came in to grab a quick drink we had kyle as our bartender and he was phenomenal all of our drinks were made perfectly and quickly he is so friendly and clearly has a lot of experience i highly recommend the ginger snap'd definitely will come back,positive
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,do you like pina coladas and getting caught in the rainthat's the vibe you getting sitting on the deck at whiskey joe's during an awesome tampa bay sunset in the background  my hubby loves the atmosphere i enjoy the drinks but on this weekend was about our only son turning 17 and he wanted to check them outmy son always wants wings as an appetizer no matter what establishment we dine at and his occasion was no different he chose the coconut rum wings and that was an excellent pick  the wings were crispy and piping hot and the glaze was amazing  for the main meal hubby orders ribs my son order shrimp alfredo's and i decided on the blue cheese sliders  my sliders were delicious handmade mini burgers served with fries my hubby and son were very satisfied with there food especially my son was at first skeptical with the shrimp alfredo since they used angel hair pasta instead of fettuccine noodles  once he took one bite all doubt was erased  my husbands only gripe with his ribs were they were too saucy he said it seems as if the top broke off the bq sauce and that is why the ribs were drowning in sauce lol  overall we enjoyed the meal,positive
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,don't be handicap and go to this restaurant  it was truly horrible to get to the receptionlong smelly hallways confusing corners almost ended up in the kitchenmother's day brunch was sure expensive for what was provided  i was completely disappointed with coffee being cold and self service bloody mary was also self service in plastic cups wowour waiter was the best part of the experience truly wonderful in every wayegyptian fellowps the place needs a refresh and get rid of the danky old carpeting,negative
kWFgllI8AfMCIvRJ2KwuRA,honestly horrible  the first time i went i had a bit of an issue but figured they just opened and still needed to work things out i tried it out again and my food was cold i was offered free ice cream which is nice but upon thinking about it later i realized that i was still mad the first time i had visited i was there for a while with friends and a family nearby had some sort of problem and they were given free ice cream too is this the way complaints are handled free ice cream what if i didnt want ice cream and wanted a refund no other option was given and i later realized that although the owners  were nice they didnt seem to really listen and hear me and my concerns i don't know if i'll be back,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,food was okay and way overpriced  the atmosphere sells this place which is a good thing because there are much better places to eat for more reasonable prices  unless you want to sit and watch the birds you're better off driving down to clearwater beach and eating at frenchy's,negative
_cbNtNu9SU_l-rb6HP27qg,i'd give this a 25  the shrimp appetizer although described by another reviewer as similar to bang bang shrimp at bonefish grill was found to be inaccurate  although the fry batter was similar the mayo coating wasn't similar and had a bitter aftertaste  the crabcakes were ok but only ok  the sweet potato fries were good  the rainbow trout dish was soso the skin wasn't crisp and the rice was dried out completely,negative
ziyXteCmNmRprs10buP2iQ,i ordered the lamb it was over cooked for me and dry the flavor was good and i would definitely like to try something else off the menu,negative
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,the restaurant is right on the water staffed with an incredible team from the valet to the waiters the beer and wine was served promptly with appetizers and my child's meal served incredibly quick my husband and i ordered the crab cake and the fried oyster appetizers crab cake  fantastic oysters ths first two that we had were delicious despite the old school flavor pallette chosen a sweet red sauce the 3rd oyster was not properly cleanedprepped as the intestine was still left inside not a pleasant taste the chef said it was part of the oyster no kiddingmy son ordered the butter noodles and it definitely was nothing but butter and noodles sans any sort of seasoning  it at least was as describedfor the entree we had the fish tacos  amazing the crunchy cabbage with the well seasoned fish and fresh tortillas encompassed all that is florida my husband ordered the raw seafood sampler and to his dismay once again the seafood was not properly cleaned  the oysters had pieces of shell left inside adding unwanted texture to raw oystersdesserts  key lime pie large portion but incrediblesadly we will not be back anytime soon,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,never again yes parking is horrible service slow big bowl little soup smaller spoon carribean cobb salad caused projectile vomiting my friends burger was bloody rare couldn't get a drink for a longgg time keep the sunset can't imagine the raw food or fish all on a thursday night glad i survived go to bahama breeze across the street never a disappointment and safe food,negative
k1yDRDZ4QCvNW9Wm9-IOaA,the two vegetarian main dishes i tried were bland and not worth the price we had the one with the broccoli and the one with the spinach the former was a little better but basically just tasted like it had been boiled in chicken stock and salted no interesting flavors in either main dish 4131 for two vegetarian dishes and a vegetarian appetizer the appetizer was the black eyed peas fritter dish which was extremely oily although the sauce it came with was tasty,negative
xVYjBVGrH1wWjfw9IJZI_g,i hate this place i've eaten here 3 times the 3rd time was the last straw i ordered two platters they said 20 minutes but i knew it would take longer 40 minutes later i get my platters boom not what tf i ordered my man informed them it was wrong  they started snapping on their employee and they said they would make what we asked for keep in mind that they close at 9pm it was about 905pm when they finished our food the first time 5 minutes later they bring our platters out to us as a way to apologize i guess but guess what they gave us the same damn platters i started to check it but i wanted to be on my way being as though we waited so long for this nasty ass food never again will y'all receive money from me i should have thrown this nasty full of bones food on y'all floor,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,very disappointed the food wasn't good my mom got the snapper and didn't touch it the waiter didn't ask any questions just said let me take it out of your way,negative
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,annoyed at the customer service we were supposed to be seated after a party left and then a couple comes in after us and they give our seats to them after we waited over 30 minutes not pleased very unprofessional host,negative
T3EnbJYkiMHutSxh0asEfA,mediocre italian food you can find much better elsewhere it's not bad it just doesn't stand out,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,it's a shame that a restaurant so beautifully located and perfectly set up could be ran so poorly the service is absolutely horrible the bartenders at the tiki bar have no customer service skills what so ever they are rude and lazy we waited for 20 minutes to get drinks while the 4 bartenders that were behind the bar stood and chatted with each other ignoring customers one bartender walked past and i said excuse me me and she said what's up and kept walking than we went upstairs to have dinner in the restaurant and the service was just as bad if not worse the waitress didn't greet the table for at least 10 minutes than she never came back to check on us once our food was delivered we had no condiments for our burgers our orders were not correct but we ate anyways because we were so hungry management was no where to be seen i'm not even sure if there was a manager on duty needless to say this place needs a lot of changes,negative
A0-S0UG8P00_T5RavArH3g,call before you go  we went the other night and the place was closed  the sign said closed in june and back in early august  as august has already passed the three week mark we wondered if it will ever open again,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,visited last week  the only thing that was good was the nachos appetizer  waitress forgot to even put in my soup order in and then gave it to me at the same time as my meal after i asked her for it three times  when i received my meal the chicken and rice were ice cold and the cheese sauce on my broccoli was like water  the other two meals in my party were not hot either  sangria was fine but the bloody mary's had no fixings and we watched two other tables served then with olives and the rest of the fixings which was disappointing  110 not edible meal ,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,i'll start with the positives  great views on the patio  the loaded fries and burger were good  now for the negatives  the drinks tasted very watered down  it took close to an hour before our appetizers arrived  waitress came by several times and asked if we were ready to place our order which we already had and insisted that the kitchen was slammed  the place was not full had a steady trickle of tables come in well after we arrived  she came back a few more times and asked if we had anywhere to be  finally the food arrived and it was good but never worth the wait  my husband handed her his card and asked her to close us out  he went to get the car  fifteen minutes later she passes by me and says she needed to take care of some other tables as they have been waiting for a long time too  another fifteen minutes later she brings our bill and card back  highly do not recommend if you don't have hours to spare for a meal,negative
YEQk2NZM5TKqyqgo1rjFsg,so we have been here now two times overall we spend about 100200 dollars every time when a game does not work you can not find staff to save your life when you do find staff it's very difficult to get anything out of them this place is very understaffed i get that it just opened but still we went to just get a fountain drink and the girl counted her drawer in front of us there should of been a person taking orders while she was in the back counting money it was very unprofessional we stood in line for a good 15 minutes not too mention when she got to us she did not look like she wanted to be there i feel like this place has amazing marketing team because i see it everywhere but i do not think customer service is their main concern,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,if you're looking for dangerous fun on the water with a bunch of irresponsible jetski owners then this is the spot for you apparently some lady was hit by a jet ski just the day before knocking her baby from her arms while i understand this place is probably not a great family atmosphere i also know that there is a certain population of people ahem hispanics that bring their skis up there just to show how awesomely cool they are 20 feet from shore going 40 if you think i'm being overly critical of one race then go find out for yourself my girlfriend and i have waverunners ourselves but it makes us look bad with all of these people out there acting like morons probably a great place to come wait for a devastating watercraft accident to happen sad to say but this is the truth of whiskey joes on the weekend,negative

BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,we had our wedding on 2817 and did a reception at rusty pelican from last 29 until 210 we found out that over 80 of our guest adults and including 6 kids under 10got sick vomiting and diarrhea including my wife we didn't go to any other restaurant after rusty pelican i called rusty pelican and they said they investigated on their side and nothing was found of course they want proof from the hospital for food poisoning  nobody in my party got sick enough to go to the hospital but one 4 yr old was taken to the walk in clinic and said it was a stomach bug which we didn't think is right food we had in the reception is steak and lobster and steak and salmon bacon scallops and cheese ravioli,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,ok so my boyfriend loves whiskey joe's and i am just not a fan i ordered the shrimp tacos with and upgrade to sweet potato fries not an upgrade the fries were soggy and cold upon arrival and before that the server brought out the wrong tacos for me the margarita i had was 7 at happy hour not real fresh squeezed lime juice just marg mix a splash of tequila and a little bit of salt on the rim i had to flag down my server after not seeing him for 15 minutes just before happy hour to get another one and got to him at 658 to put it in he ended up charging 9 anyways instead of coming around and asking would you like another marg before happy hour ends unimpressive and the service was bad 2 stars only for the view in the bar area my boyfriend loves the wings because they are huge yet they came out today as regular wings you can get anywhere yet they are the same price as they've always been and no explanation that they have changed their recipe no thanks i would only go for the view and the company i bring,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,dirty and just needs a total makeover service was horrible bartenders were rude and had no customer service skills,negative
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,i rate this place with 1 star only for the beautiful view our table had to offer  everything else was not good at all  let me explain  we had been at this restaurant last about 20 years ago and we had a wonderful experience at that time  we went to this place last evening to impress a cousin my wife who she has not seen in probably 40 years  the service we got from our server victoria was atrocious   she had no personality could answer no questions about the meals and did not even know what bearnaise sauce was  in short we felt like we were interrupting her evening  needless to say we did not receive the superb service this restaurant was known for in past years or any pleasant service at all from victoria when returning a drink that was not correct she went back to the bartender and my wife saw her roll her eyes when she gave it back to him laughing  is this a laughing matter we ordered fillet mignon where we had a better cut of meat at outback steakhouse by far the following day  i also ordered a lobster tail with mine too my lobster tail was underdone we ordered bananas foster where we received a dish of soup with about 12 scoop of ice cream and 3 small slices of bananas where she lit it with a cigarette lighter to give us the tableside experience this dessert was supposed to offer  we just received a text from our company who my wife wanted to impress last evening and said that they received a better meal at duffy's in tampa this evening than the one presented by the rusty pelican last evening with far better service at duffy's too  needless to say the price of the meal they had was not as much as a good service tip at the rusty pelican  i don't believe the rusty pelican will ever see me back in their establishment   there are far too many better places to have a great meal in tampa where i can spend 400  this used to be  a great place to go  what happened,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,i find it hard to rate this place overall two friends and i came for lunch on a friday afternoon our server was amazing very helpful and accommodating the food was definitely above par for a beach bar i had the shrimp tacos and they were delicious we were really enjoying our visitthen as we were waiting for our car at valet one of the employees from the hostess stand came outside and accused me of taking pictures of her i assured her that i did not because why would i she said well my coworkers saw you it's illegal to take pictures of someone so i got out my phone and showed her all the pictures i had taken in the last 24 hours obviously none were of her instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding she simply turned around and went back inside it was just uncomfortable and weird and would keep me from coming back,negative
YEQk2NZM5TKqyqgo1rjFsg,ugh great idea impact was totally off this place is disgustingly dirty we tried to bowl and the floors were so dirty our shoes slid all over the place the tables at our alley had dirty dishes from previous guests that no one came to pick up we ended up having to clear ourselves and pushed to the back two hours later still sitting there it also took about 15 minutes to get a drink  that totally sucked since it ate up our hour of bowling don't waste your time it's expensive and nasty,negative
tXpUVcs5W7R3q-zixsXg_A,expensive and rude service spent 15 for 3 piece of whiting fish i used to go all the time but after the last visit i will not return they wouldn't even give me hot sauce after i just spend over 25 for 2 meals they dont care about the loyal customers,negative
K0Cw8KXgF23sEji9TnfBkA,i was looking forward to dinner with my family on my birthday after we were all vaccinated i had planned a visit on easter but an issue developed  the staff were lovely and we received a gift certificate for later i did not go to the green room frequently and the renovation was casual and pleasant  ceiling was spectacular as always  the menu was limited  i was prepared for that but they were out of other food items too my niece ordered an old fashioned and they didn't have the mix i was prepared that you would pay for the rolls but a sweet young man named matt was responsible for running to all the tables with food and putting it down  the rolls came in a teeny round bowl it looked a bit like a snail we figured out it must be the roll  one it was uh  the food was limited i ordered foie gras and they were out of it  my husband had decided on a pasta he saw at home they did not have it onto what we had  the onion soup was mediocre steak frittes tasty hamburgers good only 2 deserts neither too good our waitress was very sweet the manager took the gift card but took a while to be cleared  they did give me a free piece of cake for my birthday very nice of them  we were all together and it was a fun evening after a year apart  it just wasn't great and don't think i would plan a meal there again  makes me a bit sad,negative
-kYESienondGaj9TFadkUg,i went here with my boyfriend and our two friends for a double date we were going to go to abyssinia which is basically right next door but we thought we'd give this place a shot since we had never been here beforeoverall kind of disappointing i don't want to bash them for the more than obvious language barrier but it really did make ordering very difficult the menu seemed easy to understand but they never really explained what the veggie sides were when we asked it was just really hard to get a clear answer also it seemed like they were operating out of a home which was just weird to me that may not be the case but that was the vibe we all got from it just a little weirded out that it wasn't a commercial kitchenpros friendly service reasonable prices good foodcons strange atmosphere confusing menu strong language barriertldr just go to abyssinia next door for better food and service,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,went for dinner saturday pm valet said lot was full either and to  park in beach lot or drive down to event parking and take shuttle back  we found a spot at beach parked paid and went into restaurant checked with hostesses  at front  they could not tell us whether we'd get locked in lot at 9 pm or not as signage stated at beach so ended up moving our car and taking shuttle after all  confusing and annoying  food was ok  waitress was great  i gave it 2 stars because we enjoyed our friends company and sitting on the outside patio,negative
k1yDRDZ4QCvNW9Wm9-IOaA,we were excited to come to bennachin because it is one of the few spots in the city that offers vegan options as well as african cuisine being on vacation it's super hard to find the combination and we set it as our last dinner destination of our trip to be short our experience was terrible the waitress was not very inviting and she didn't have any solid information on how the food was prepared the rice we had wasn't coconut rice as advertised it was rice with peas carrots and corn that you buy at any old store the fish that i asked for wasn't prepared in the way i ordered it once i realized it after eating a few bites i brought it to the attention of the waitress she told me that it was prepared in the way i ordered it ginger and garlic saucethere was no sauce on the fish and since i ate some already they couldn't change it for me they ended up taking it off the bill so that's why i'm giving them a second star on top of that the waitress threw the bill on the table and scurried off terrible service and we didn't get the african dining experience we expected really sad the service there needs to be stepped up,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,scam alert  we came for dinner and at the valet's instructions parked our car at ben t davis beach even though there were empty spaces in the lot  a few hours later when we went to get the car the lot was locked up and the valet refused to help  there were a dozen cars with diners from the restaurant who shared our predicament  the restaurant's manager nick said they were having a problem with the valet who appeared to be running their own operation on the side  by the time the police opened up the lot it was past midnight  avoid like the plague,negative
Aqsc1lA8-PN8YNMgroyeSg,my first time ordering from here and food was absolutely disgusting i ordered jollof rice and they gave me white rice with some type of sauce on it i don't know if they were good at one time and just stop caring but i would never go back southwest philadelphia has way better options if your looking for good quality african food,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,went with my family once and was amazing the first time around and had no complaints while waiting in the barefoot bar next time we went i ordered the jumbo shrimp and the rice first came out dry and vegetables were okay woke up in the middle of the night with horrible food poisoning knowing it is from the shrimp i know there's a risk when eating fish but have never had anything like this happen before won't be coming back unless for the barefoot bar for drinks,negative
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,appetizer calamari it says it comes with tempura peppers  onions those are just fillers to your tempura calamari and your calamari is just a breaded crumble mess we couldn't find any whole rings just half rings of calamari  absolutely no tentacles mostly tempura onion  pepper strips i ordered the lump pay attention here crab meat stuffed grouper i asked if the crab was really lump crab meat our server said that it was lump but they shredded it if i wasn't so set on having that i should've known better you never shred lump crab meat the shredded crab was fishy tasting  grouper was dried out i took one bite  asked for it to be taken away  luckily we were compensated for it my partner got a filet under seasoned  cold with one small roasted onion  5050 potatoes also cold  otherwise 5050 mashed were really good as they say they're 50 part potato  50 part butter  cream what could be wrong with that lol they were seasoned well  quite creamy drinks are overpriced and my fountain coke was flat overall i think there are plenty better seafood restaurants around we will not be repeat customers,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,average very average with a hefty price tag for food the portobellos in paradise is essentially 2 grilled portobello caps  some regular yellow rice  a couple fried plantains with a couple of red peppers for 21 dollars yes twenty one  it's insane and i was expecting a lot more mushrooms for the price point but let's talk about the taste while the mushrooms are grilled decently  there's a bit of balsamic reduction without enough salt to make them appealing  i'd have to take the saltier island rice and use that as a way to enhance the flavor of them the  plantains were fried well maybe a tad over cooked and they were my favorite part of the plate the service was great  fortunately i arrived during the day so there was minimal customers the view itself was great though  would i come back for food no but maybe some drinks,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,great view location food was mediocre at best ordered signature tequila garlic shrimp appetizer it was not very goodtiny and very few shrimp the grouper entree came out cold and was small for the price net not a repeat for a meal but a drink at sunset is a maybe,negative
ajeJQlYpzALo8WTe9gdxCQ,extremely slow and it's not even crowded waited in line forever and we also had to wait forever just for drinks poor service and do not recommend go to one of the other cracker barrel's not this one as they are very unorganized,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,ef this place after talking this place up for days to 2 24yr old girls that were visiting from out of town as a it seems great place to have lunch and hang out on beach for drinks  they came back and said it sucked worst so far in tampa receptionist ignored them for seating they had to ask to be seated for lunch yet no one else was waiting once seated it took forever for food server was rude and then they never came to clear table place was empty  when they finally made it outside they were blown off by servers   to top it off they were charged for drinks that were never ordered these are 2 very polite well behaved 24 year old girls that any place would welcome and has everywhere else in tampa has been awesome for them ef this place lost a customer and a referral  wjs disappoints,negative

ajeJQlYpzALo8WTe9gdxCQ,meehhh the wait to be greeted by a server and for the food was too long for it to be a weekday morning i ordered the biscuit french toast eggs and turkey sausage my eggs arrived covered in blackberry and my sausage patty was burnt on the underside clearly turned over to conceal the burn,negative
S-VD26LE_LeJNx5nASk_pw,ate here last night  was very disappointed in the service received decided to eat in because i live too far from the location once i was ready to order i asked the waitress about an item on the menu she then explained oh i don't know i'm just helping my aunt out today she didn't attempt to find out she just stood there so i order my fiancé orders another couple comes in they order after about 45 minutes i'm like where is our food she says about another 30 min i'm appalled at this point she then goes into explaining how grilled fish takes longer than fried fish whatever she brings an appetizer to the table and i'm like what's this it apparently was for the other couple that came in about 45 min after we did this other couple also got their food before we did at this point i tell her we have to leave magically the food is ready my appetite is gone we're frustrated never have i waited an hour and a half for food what was most annoying was the confusion on part of the waitress in the end we were brought the wrong check and the price of the food was higher than what was on the menu the cashier says oh it costs more when the fish is bigger than usual this is one first time customer who will give no second chances oh and the food was good but not that good i've had better and with better service,negative
ANbQwZEtt-b2JeEruRPi2A,the oxtail was the worst i ever had it was dry and tough seems like it was left over and reheated several times the jerk chicken was better  i won't be going to this restaurant again,negative
Aelkw-nyg9I8aQM9mK_yhw,worst customer service i ever had at a restaurant i was asked by a woman sitting in a chair what are you doing here then another woman who gave me my food argued with me and told me i owed more money when i paid online i would never order food from here again,negative
PYZJFov6aGScr55PnmDVFw,this place has very inconsistent food quality  sometimes it's good and other times it tastes old and dried out the customer service absolutely sucks the women are rude and nasty and are very impatient i had to call back and cancel my order because i felt so unsettled knowing that i was about to give my hard earned money to a place that treated me so poorly order at your own risk and beware of the rude mannerisms,negative
YEQk2NZM5TKqyqgo1rjFsg,if i could make it a half star i would went here three times first visit was on my companies dime so it wasn't that bad the service was extremely slow to deliver food and drinks to party memberssecond visit very slow service yet again the servers got in an argument with the party in the bowling lane next to us additionally they had problems dividing the food ordered between multiple lanes orders being delivered to the wrong table etc  towards the end of the night they closed multiple activities an hour before closing time leaving bowling the only option i still gave the place a benefit of the doubt because it does have good activities so i wanted to take some friends there  again the service was terrible to deal with  we arrived at 8pm and wanted to bowl but there was a 3 hour wait pretty hefty wait but no problem for us so we requested to be put on the waiting list but they said the waiting list was full  there was currently 6 groups on the list we decided to wait around for ten minutes to try to decide what we wanted to do for the remainder of the night since we traveled 50mins to get there so while waiting there a group was removed off of the waiting list because another group finished bowling  obviously we went to put our names on the wait list but the extremely rude lady said no she wasn't going to add us because now the wait is 4 hours now how does the amount of people waiting shrink but the wait time increases a upper class place with good activities like that should not have terrible service  i will never make the trip back up there highly recommend avoiding this place due to their service alone  the staff seems like they weren't trained on the 'customer service' side of business,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,i will never return here again and it was my first time we were seated and then waited 20 minutes to get service and that's only because my friend got up and got someone while other around us were tended to our appetizer came out wrong and when we told the waitress it was incorrect she got an attitude with us then my friend had asked for a heineken four times to three different people before he was finally given it w an attitude again when the waitress brought out i will order my friend let her know that it was horrible service not in a rude way or anything and she started yelling at him saying fine then don't tip me bro it's whatever completely embarrassing my friend went and got the manager that we had to wait forever for while the girls at the bar just talked and looked at us making it completely uncomfortable the manager finally came and apologized so on and so forth and ordered to comp drinks we didn't have besides the beer and i let her know it wasn't about that  we came to have dinner not to be treated so horribly from the jump  the manager goes over to the bar register to get our check and me and my friend are at the table discussing how we can't believe that this is actually happening and how we have never experienced something like this another girl comes over and approaches us about our conversation saying they work together and stick together  like what in the actual  it's not even like me and my friend were talking loud and being obnoxious about the situation we were completely flabbergasted by what was happening from what i did saw anyway they serve subpar food for a pricey amount we didn't even get to enjoy our whole dinner at 930 at night and still paid yes a discounted price but like i said it wasn't about that for what felt like nothing like i paid to get treated badly,negative
nL7p1fol3N_2y_PrhiQNog,well the food was fine service decent the problem the whole restaurant smells like a giant toilet it was overwhelming and hits you as soon as you walk in the front door it continues to the hostess stand and follows you into the restaurant in addition to the horrible overwhelming toilet smell my feet stuck to the floor everywhere i walked if i wouldn't have been with a group i would have run out the door no way this place is clean i will never ever be back,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,horrible  don't bother  took a party of 7 3 12 hrs to complete our meal  worst service ever  we had to get our own plates for our apps  server either too lazy or too stupid,negative
YEQk2NZM5TKqyqgo1rjFsg,not impressed we went for our first time to entertain the three of us two adults and a young boy under 12 50 for 1 hour of bowling 20 for pizza which didn't taste well all dough adult cocktails just for two were 20 70 gaming card we asked right away what incentives are available as we showed up to have a great evening of entertainment we found out later that night you have to purchase wrist bands for 1215 per person the day before for all day gaming this does not compare dave and busters where we could have easily enjoyed a sit down dinner with drinks and entertainment probably less than 100 for the three of us,negative
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,we visited tonight a sunday with a party of 7 we had reservations and were seated promptly in the large party room we soon realized that a wedding reception was being held in the adjacent room to where we were seated after the appetizers we noticed an open table across the room i approached the manager and asked if we could be moved as we were unable to hear one another over the loud music the manager stated that it was not possible as they had other parties waiting i returned to the table and told the waitress what i had requested she promptly moved us and we were sort of relieved to be across the room if you are booking a large party i would definitely be aware of the proximity to any events that are taking place as it is loud our server was great and tried to accommodate as well as she could my advice to the inept manager i talked to is to at least pretend to help your customers when they have a complaintnow for the food we were a party of 5 adults and 2 children we ordered appetizers as well as entrees the french onion soup was okay and the caesar salad was good the scallop appetizer was on point highly recommend the shrimp cocktail and coconut shrimp were subpar and we would not order again we ordered 3 filets and all appeared to be cooked to the same temp even though we ordered one medium rare one medium and one medium well basically save yourself some money and go somewhere else we definitely will not be back especially for 300 without alcohol signed not normally a karen but i'll own it tonight,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,i went here about 5 years ago and i remembered it being good so i decided to try it again  ugh  we sat down and not 1 person acknowledged us  we waited about 15 mins to put in our drink orderwe should've just left then   we ordered 2 appetizersand we were gonna order more but after waiting 30 mins to get chips with queso we couldn't believe our 2nd appetizer never came out  the queso was cold not melted at all so we just asked the waitress to pop it in the microwave for us real quick bc we were starving we finished the chips and still no wingsshe came back about 15 mins apologizing for the wait  we are currently still here waiting for the wings20 mins after we finished the chips i wish we could just get our check and leave  i don't even want them anymore,negative

1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,we went to this place for a graduation dinner this afternoon with a party of 15 at 3pm  which at that time of day there was hardly any other tables filled  and i have to say this place was just aweful from the the beginning the service just getting our drink orders was bad we waited forever for everything we ordered we also ordered a bottle of champagne and that even took 45 minutes to bring to the table the wait staffs excuse was that they had to first go find some thenit had to be chilled instead of telling us this when we initially placed the order and giving us the option to choose something different  they just made us wait the food orders were also all wrong and the waitresses were very ambivalent about the whole issue when we asked for the manager his attitude was just as bad he never offered to make things right by any means then the food came out and it was aweful i felt so bad for the mother of the graduate that spent so much money for the mealsi will definitely never eat at this place again,negative
cJZmRIGu3AyjJivezu7R0w,stay away  went with my 93 year old dad hostess sat us at a dirty table asked her if it was clean she replied yes it was not we cleaned the table ourselves with clorox wipes they proceeded to seat people on both sides of us with no distancing  waitress then  came and took our order simple breakfast and water she returned with the water dropped straw an floor then picked back up and placed on table for us to use  got order the pancakes were burnt and placed with burnt side down thinking we would not notice asked for well done bacon and was received barely cooked asked for gravy on potatoes and was charged 399 for the gravy the entire time a waiter with a beard was walking around with his mask hanging off one ear very poor service unclean and terrible experience all the way around,negative

YEQk2NZM5TKqyqgo1rjFsg,service is horrible  came on a weeknight not busy at all  we paid for an hour of bowling at which time i specifically asked if a waitperson would come by and she confirmed  15minutes later i asked again and she said they are walking around  i asked a girl walking by with the main event shirt she said that she was the party hostess and they were slammed but someone would come by  and again hardly anyone there so i'm not sure how she thinks they are slammed  then i see a waitress with a tray of drinks and she said that she would be back after dropping off the drinks  about 10 mins later she comes back  now we are 35 minutes into the game order drinks and appetizers  our drinks come 10 minutes later and our appetizers arrive with 5 minutes left in our hour  have 2 sets left to play and game shuts down at exactly one hour  then another 12 hour trying to get bill and pay  no apologies for our wait and my husband checked bar area and no customers but 4 workers are just hanging out,negative

BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,wondered why this place had openings for brunch on a very busy sunday but thought we'd give it a try we're locals and had out of town guests and wanted to go somewhere different on the way to the airport  the brunch was mediocre at best from the obvious grocery store white mini bagels no other breads offered than run of the mill cinnamon rolls that looked mass produced also to the ho hum boring scrambled eggs and empty bacon serving platter a spicy bloody mary was ordered and was so hot and fiery that it was not ingestible the waiter came back to report that the mild bloody mix was out the four of us were packed into a small table for four we had reservations next to a table of 6 people that had 6 large bags of luggage lined up against the wall by our table making us have to squeeze to get in and out to get to the buffet that was in a whole other room the waiter moved one of bags when i asked to make some room for us  our server josh really tried hard and was very pleasant and attentive but unfortunately it didn't make up for the blasé food the terribly outdated decor the large holes in carpet beneath our table and all the tables that should've been replaced at least 10 years ago very beat up place and don't let the photos mislead you there is no outdoor seating terrible embarrassing experience  i live in tampa and trust me there are many many other restaurants that serve a far superior brunch to this place and for less money oh yeah the price was outrageous for the quality and dumpy surroundings,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,i was going to rate a 1star but there was 1 saving grace this is my second experience here my first visit was several years ago  it was nothing memorable then this visit we stopped here and decided to eat outside we were seated and waited over 20 minutes for a server and no one came by when 2 other tables were seated and waited on we drew the line and went inside to say something because that is unacceptable after explaining another waitress our complaints they sat us in another section  where again we were ignored at this point we normally would have just got up and left if we weren't so hungry here lies the only saving grace that got this place 2stars finally another server came by  asked us of we were being served and said he would take care of us even though it wasn't his section marshall is the only reason i'm giving this place any stars he was a fantastic server but unfortunately seems like he was only decent employee in the place the food was mediocre nothing to write home about typical barfare that we expected so this place has a nice view of the bay and ok food but it's not worth the absolutely terrible service,negative
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,this is an expensive restaurant for three reasons the food the view the service we didn't experience any of these we went for bunch on sunday dec 19 and were  seated so far from the windows that none of us had a view there was a very loud party of 20 between us and the windows i thought ok the food will be good nope most of us ordered eggs benedict and all of our eggs were over cooked the eggs are supposed to be poached with yummy runny yolks that cascade down nope all the eggs were closer to hard boiled than poached the food was also closer to cold than hot when it came out service wasn't good we ordered mimosa by the bottle and she brought the juices out in glasses so when pouring the juice into the champagne glass it made a huge mess it was just so disappointment and not worth the very high bill,negative
cJZmRIGu3AyjJivezu7R0w,it's christmas eve and i'm picking up my order for christmas day dinner there are a couple people waiting in front of me i could tell they were frustrated one lady said she had been waiting for an hour on gravy left out of her order  i experienced a human grinch in the next few minutes but the heartless attitude of the manager to the other lady was unforgivable she to was picking up her order for christmas dinner as the manager spoke with her i sensed his i could care less attitude he said that her order wasn't in the system she tried explaining to him that it was already paid for he offered no help or anything to correct the problem he just turned and walked away as the lady walked out with tears streaming down her face i offered her my sympathy she stated that she had family coming to her home and that she didn't have money to purchase another dinner so the grinch is alive and doing his deeds at the cracker barrel in hendersonville tennessee he didn't have a name tag or i would call him out this is my last purchase at cracker barrel they could care less about the customer,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,my husband and i came here to celebrate the new year last nightparking was better than we thought it would be after reading all of the reviews about the parking here we were able to find a spot right away with at least 10 more parking spaces still available around us they charges us 20 each just to get in after i called 2 days before and the young lady that answered said it would be a 15 cover charge moving on so we get in and get seated within 1015 minutes which was cool and our server i wish i could remember her name was phenomenal the food however sucked i mean really really sucked my husband ordered there famous buffalo wings they were so huge which seemed like they came from a chicken heavily injected with hormones or somethingand they were dry i order the mango glazed scallops along with broccoli and cheddar as a side the scallops were soo salty they taste like the cook dropped the salt container on them and just kept cooking them the broccoli was too hard to even cut with a sharp knife under cooked if it was even cooked at all and the cheese was like a cheap shredded cheese tossed on top we pretty much knocked this restaurant off our go to list this place has so much potential with the location too bad the food is horrible,negative
TUCm1lCkh-usRYRl3U0S8w,went to this place once good food  at least the one i had kitchen cleanliness is a disaster customer servicezero all the way around,negative
gY6xgzPZXPv-8R70cADfqA,we decided to stop in for lunch around 230 or so there were only three other tables full at the restaurant yet it took forever to sit downthen when we decided to order something on the menu it was either run out for the day or they didn't have it at alli ended up getting their hibiscus drink it tasted like it came from a high c bottle my husband got the fried catfish and i got the curry chicken  disliked bothchicken was cold and pink on the inside the only good thing about the meal was the black beans and rice and fried plantains not very impressed nor will we be back,negative
ajeJQlYpzALo8WTe9gdxCQ,very messy and incredibly rude staff the wait time was a bit long which is to be expected since this place is usually so great but during our wait time we looked around in the shop area and we just seemed to be in every employee's way they all seemed offended by our very presence love the restaurant in general but will not be going to this location again,negative
-kYESienondGaj9TFadkUg,i've never been to a slower and illtasting food establishment in my life,negative
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,we were here on a monday with a large group  the restaurant is closed for regular dining but they book large parties and events  our group was offered 2 choices  'filet' of beef and mahi mahi  they brought the salads out first plate bottoms on top of salad while they were stacked on waiters tray  the salads all were slathered in some gross orange dressing making my salad inedible  our main server a mature woman was more like the 'take it and you will like it' type  a stench of old fish was noticeable when they brought the entrées in  two people at our table had the mahi mahi a third person tasted it and all three said the fish was bad as in spoiled or tainted   when we brought this to the attention of the server she ripped one plate away and promptly returned with an overdone filet with a few hastily scattered potatoes and green beans  the servers says 'the chef ate tour meal says the fish is fine we just got it today  you're from california  mahi mahi tastes different  it was explained 2 of the 3 tasters were from hawaii and mahi mahi is very commonly served in southern california as well    the second person was told it would be 20 minutes  but their plate was fresh and beautifully plated  coffee was served but not until after dessert was finished  the views of the bay are perfect  no cannot recommend this place,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,last time we came it was a great experience this time not so much we were immediately greeted by a semi rude valet who informed us their entire lot was for valet only sneaky way to take us for more money i presume then as we get inside we were not even welcomed but informed that our party of 10 at 500pm would not be able to be seated for 2 hours even though the restaurant was not full not a sorry we have reservations or any other explanation just a we can't seat you for 2 hours i can get the manager if you want we were directed to the beach bar to top off the experience as we were leaving our driver had to walk to the beach lot since we didn't want to do the valet as he came to pick us up he was again rudely informed it was a valet lot and had to turn around to come pick us up it wasn't even busy yet there wasn't any other cars driving in the lot this restaurant is trying to be something it's not you'd think i was at an upscale steakhouse but in reality all it is is overpriced bar food won't be back when we come through orlando again and will deter others as well,negative
cJZmRIGu3AyjJivezu7R0w,i am done with this cracker barrel the food has gone down hill fast and we used to come in here almost every weekend for breakfast the eggs you get when you order a meal with 2 are like sparrow eggs i'm also mad over how the biscuits are now so much smaller but the prices have gone up the thing that i will not stand for is people bringing their dang dogs in if the management can't say no to these people that think it's ok for the family pet to come in i will say no to me coming in it's gotten so out of hand where people take the pets now i love dogs but they don't need to come in restaurants or lowe's unless it's a true service dog,negative
YEQk2NZM5TKqyqgo1rjFsg,we'd never been to main event until tonight and most likely will never go again did the reservation online not a problem reserved a lane from 910pm on a saturday night not a problemarrive early to check in and uh oh  there's mass chaos at the checkin area lots of employees standing around but very few actually seem to be working weird since the line isn't that longget to the lane  no one turns the lane on for us to begin bowling until 915 had to ask three different people and one guy with a headset seemed really annoyed said he'd do it then never did but then the lane shuts down promptly at 10pmfor 5 people to bowl for 45 minutes cost me 62  and don't even get me started on the crappy service after waiting until 925 to get served we order 3 waters 2 pepsi's and 1 mixed drink  20 minutes later it finally arrives twenty our time was almost over before we even got our drinkswhen i asked what took so long the waitress says well we had a large party  um news flash  i'm a paying customer and i don't really care about that party i care about prompt service for my family while we're paying for time especially since we're on the clock and service is amazingly slowplace seemed understaffed poorly managed and since you essentially pay for your time we got ripped off with bowling and with slow inattentive service go to pinheads in fishers or honestly anywhere else and save yourself the frustration and headache of main event,negative

HLNtxaFvvHFx9whiptQzOg,absolutely horrible  i purchased the bbq chicken dinner 3400 on a wednesday and the result was inedible  the skin was rubbery the meat was old and dry chicken leg quarter looked like a thin rabbit leg  it is my understanding the chickens are grilled on sunday and then sold throughout the week  the meat is not the highest quality either  the chef has quit in the past few months and now the food is very bad don't waste your money,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,would not recommend as a place for a large group i had a group of 20 on a sunday evening and even though reservation was made more than a week before service was horrible had to hunt down a waitress to take orders from us one hour after the reservation time and then beg to get our checks at the end waitresses stopped by not even once in 3 hours to check up on us i tipped how much i thought the servers worked for actually i thought i was being generous with what i tipped given how little they did only to face a waitress confronting me at the end with the elusive was everything okay because we live on tips lol come on i had asked for tables conducive for socializing and even though there were tables in a corner area perfect for the purpose i was instead given a looong linear table in the middle of the restaurant given the perfect location and views they have going on for them i think they would do sooo much better if they hired the right people to attend on clients end of vent,negative
v8ZUd9TePnvYSifCQFCueA,i've drove past this place many times before  i wish i would have kept driving by i paid 12 for a plate of oxtail rice  beans and macaroni  cheese the rice  beans were decent but they needed salt the oxtail was absolutely terrible there was so much fat on them  they gave me a piece that looked like a spare rib it was so chewy and had no gravy the mac  cheese was the highlight of the meal i will not be returning,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,i came here saturday night for a large work function the way the restaurant and  valet is run needs major improvement we were told we could not use valet even though there were plenty of valet parking spaces available we had to drive all the way to a garage then be shuttled in and still had to pay 5 for valet valet parking takes up all but maybe four parking spaces at the restaurant it's a scheme and i definitely felt cheated the food was cold when we ate and the prices for drinks were way too high i can't understand for the life of me why people go here other than they're too drunk to realize my best tip to the management is to get a new valet company  that's the first impression,negative
ajeJQlYpzALo8WTe9gdxCQ,let me start off by saying that i have been to many cracker barrel locations and not once have i had a bad experience like i did in this particular one i went on a sunday which i understand can be one of the busiest days of the week i've worked as a waitresshost before so i absolutely am not one to complain easily about them unfortunately this experience was just so terrible and unpleasant that i am left with no other option my fiancé and i were seated quickly and politely by the hostess we waited about 10 mins for our waiter to come take our drinks  he quickly got us our drinks he then began taking our order and we waited about 20 minutes to get our food which i thought was okay considering it's a sunday he brought our food and then proceeded to ask us if we needed anything else we replied yes we need some mayo  tabasco sauce as well as a refill on our drinks mind you i waited 20 mins for food so we finished our drinks while waiting he said he'd bring them right out and we waited believe me the food looked amazing  but it would've been better if we could have enjoyed it while it was still warm we patiently waited for our waiter to come back with what we requested 20 more minutes he comes to our table without our condiments nor drinks  proceeds to ask the dumbest question do you need togoboxesi was most absolutely outraged we waiting patiently thinking he must be busy we sat and watched as he brought other clients their food and drinks i will most definitely not come back to this location nor do i recommend this to anyone in the area i'd rather drive to a whole different city in tn if it means getting good service unbelievable,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,this place could be so much better than it currently is it  has endless potential with the amazing water view and location near downtown tampa it's ruined by the poor service and food first off they separated our group into two different tables which was a bad first impression next they didn't provide water until we asked twice and it took 20 minutes to receive a drink i saw with my own eyes a server drop a whole tray of hot food right next to another table and took forever to clean off tables our original plan was to get a quick dinner and to enjoy the sunset on the beach but we ended up sitting at our table inside for 3 hours do not go to this place unless you're already drunk or if you want to spend 60 to get drunk needsomelove,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,2 star rating for the great location everything else was below parthe running theme about being ripped off on drink prices is true so keep your receipts in order to fight with managementthis is a one and done place no customer service whatsoever,negative
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,we dined in for brunch we are long time customers by the way brunch should have been simple but it was a disaster we had a party of 2 my husband ordered the fried chicken and waffles i had unlimited mimosas and an order of chilled snow crab legs now because of covid the buffet is no longer open which means everything is a la cart i was already paying the unjustifiable price of 29 for half a pound of snow crab legs they used to be unlimited on the buffet but i was willing to because they have very very good snow crab here so our waiter was unattentive he wasn't friendly and was continuously preoccupied with things that didn't matter as much as tending to his tables i have always always had great service at rusty pelican in the past and everyone at every other table around me was getting great service just not us so we wait almost an hour for our food and only my husband's food comes out we wait another 20 minutes before the waiter comes by and says the manager will explain your food now by this time i am like what is there to explain it doesn't even need to be cookedthe manager tells me they lost the ticket and that's why my food never came out yet my husband's food didso another 20 minutes pass and they finally bring out the snow crab and its room temperature like not even the least bit cold it lacked flavor and the texture was off it wasn't worth the 29 they wanted for it at all this was an extremely disappointing brunch waiting 2 hours for my food while my husband's food is sitting there at the table getting cold i don't know what my waiters issue was or what the real story was with my food but i am not buying the story i was told also unless they bring back brunch this place is a hard pass now the chicken and waffles were great according to my husband its really too bad they messed up everything else,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,ehhh unlikely i will return  quick version bad service and everyone looks like they'd rather be somewhere elsei arrived to the restaurant and since i was a party of one they assumed that i did not want a table   the host and hostess kind of waved me in the area of the bar seating  i asked for a table there were obviously plenty available and i was pressured to sit in bar area  i sat in bar for almost 20 minutes without being greeted  fyi i counted the time on my phone  mind you all employees are chatting each other up and playing and interacting with each other although some appeared busy there was definitely a choice to be inattentive  in addition why does it look like everyone just rolled out of bed  i get a laid back environment in addition to working in outdoor conditions however i would expect to be groomed with decent clothes at your workplace  the ladies all wear messy buns and look like they haven't combed their hair since yesterday   it appears that the employees where their old workout gear or tethered clothes because they are in a laid back environment  there are multiple ways to present yourself as groomed and well managed in a laid back environment  i eventually was able to flag someone walking by and they told me that i was not in their section   the next thing i know a bartender shouted that she would be with me  i was rushed to order cocktail  never offered any water i had to get her attention again for the appetizer  meanwhile she took more than enough time at every other table  carrying on light conversations and again conversing with other employees  after 45 minutes i decided that i would just leave  i am cannot beg for a server to provide decent service   i cannot believe i was at a restaurant for an hour to receive one cocktail and an appetizer  i left and went to bahama breeze for dinner  it was amazing would highly recommend you avoid this place whiskey joe's  and go to bahama breeze if you want good foodcocktails live music and great servicei will say that my island firecracker shrimp was delish but not enough to suffer through bad service,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,the worst service  four servers behind the counter not busy no one ask what i wanted the grouper sandwich was the worst tasting i ever had  the cole slaw did not have a taste horrible service stay away  save your money ,negative
T6c7iPO8Y4t_GQiyevZbiQ,servings were very small  called to order no answer no notice of being closed drove over 20 minutes to see a note on the door  very disappointing as i had family i wanted to introduce to their food,negative
HLNtxaFvvHFx9whiptQzOg,i went a while back during the month of december and none were wearing masks despite the city requirement and having a sign saying masks were required for entry to make matters worse their  fried plantain  was literally heated up in their microwave i could see it being  cooked  the plantain may have been hot but it was tasteless stale and hard disappointed,negative

1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,came here for my birthday dinner and was kind of iffy about it because of the mix reviews  we decided to try it out  ourselves  we got the outdoor sitting which was great and love the water view  ordered our appetizers and dinners plus our alcohols  our waiter took 15  20 mins to bring our alcohols and still waiting on our appetizers to come  35 mins later our waiter bring us our appetizers along with our entrees  which was very disappointing may i add because we expected our appetizers first while waiting for our entrees  our dinner food was a disaster because it wasn't hot nor warm cold  not once did our waiter come by our table to check on us to see if we wanted anything else like more refill on the soda or more alcohol  my birthday dinner was very disappointing and was not happy  we will definitely not come back  the 5 valet parking was no issue for us and we still manage to tip and tip our waiter too even though he didn't do his job right,negative
zuKnCtZQKZqnvEaKVnwVVQ,there food is over priced and not good the restaurant has an unpleasant smell to it which i'm not to happy with i'm not sayin people can't speak in their native language but when you have customers you shouldn't stand in their face and talk it's just plain old rude try to kind of avoid this restaurant and find a different one ,negative
52wBQghQ0jwzSuvLvwe5rA,the usual downtown spots we go to for lunch had 40min waits so when we walked past an empty funky monk we decided to try it out although we are aware this place is primarily a bar one of the security guys who was extremely polite and welcoming talked us through the full menu really talking up the food and he wasn't lying the food was in fact delicious unfortunately this gentleman and the food are the only reason i give this place any stars at all like the description in many of the other yelp reviews the bartendersservers are the rudest most inattentive and inefficient i've come across mia who happened to be our server was discourteous from the get go always curt and rushed despite an empty bar our group of 4 ended up being primarily served and tended to by the same gentleman we encountered at the beginning the kicker however came at the end our group provided two credit cards to have the bill split 5050 mia ended up charging the full bill on a single card and then still charged an additional 50 of the total on the second card in essence racking up nearly a 100 lunch bill don't get me wrong the food was good but certainly not worth that chunk of change and the service was just plain awful when we called her to bring the error to her attention she first pretended not to hear us despite being a mere 3 feet away then she got all huffy and pretended to go and fix it only to come back and say it had been done correctly the first time and that even though the total on the credit card slip said something else only half had been charged disputing the charge through the bank won't be an issue however it is unfortunate that a place that clearly has the potential to fill a void in the dining market downtown in addition to its nightlife commerce is sadly being hindered either by poorly trained employees or downright incompetent irritable and moody ones a loss for tucson consumers and i can't imagine this would make any business owner very happy either,negative
YDisPepPeWeELiVGycxOlw,gave it one more shot  same deal  i got off th 34 to have a postwork cocktail and dinner  my friend who i was meeting was already there waiting  i ordered my drink and saw they're still measured like many of the ethiopian places in the neighborhood and when i say measured i mean smaaaaall  ok i can work with that  speaking of measured drinks  what's up with this philly you know the black dohicky attached to a nozzle or something and placed over the bottlei noticed the back room was cleared out for dancing  it was still fairly early so i did not think the dancing would start until much later  about five minutes later the disco lights came on andboom boom boom  the music was turned on and up and up and upinstead of ordering dinner as we'd planned to do we left  there was no way either of us were going to sit chat and try to eat a meal while having extremely loud music pounding at the volume of eleventymillion  music great higher volume music i'm ok with that too  this however was almost deafening and my friend and i had to yell at each other to hear each other as we were leaving a gentleman who was perched at the end of the bar closest to the door gave me total stink eye  i've seen him there almost every time i've gone but had never spoken to him so i'm not sure what that was about  my friend informed me he's the owner oooooo kay then,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,i have been to whiskey joes several times over the years and by far this was the worst experience sitting on the deck during happy hour two drinks and a hummus appetizer we walked out after 23 minutes from the time of order well over 30 min total just a complete lack of respect and appreciation for customers they have now burned a bridge with me and i will never return call me petty but i work hard for my money and i draw a line when it comes to my expectations they abused it i'm done you've been warned,negative
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,my wife and i dined here on a saturday night we truly regret coming to this restaurant let me explain we ordered the seafood chowder it was very salty red broth soup was the worst seafood soup i ever had we ordered a seafood platter it came with 1 scallop 1 tiny tiny lobster tail 3 shrimp and a small piece of grouper  this plate was 40the 1 scallop and the grouper tasted pretty good the lobster was not prepared properly and was chewy the asparagus they served had 0 flavorseasoning on it ialso we had oysters they were very small and we weren't even served property oyster forms to eat them this restaurant is fine dining their prices put them in competition  with eddie v's when you pay this much money you expect your food to be good the food was sub par we both regretted coming to this restaurant and wished we just went to eddie v's where the oysters are amazing and all the food is amazing on a positive note for the restaurant our server was kind and even though we came at night i can tell that if you came during the daylight you would have a very beautiful view of the ocean while dining,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,i live very close and should be a regular but i'm not because i consistently get terrible service i was a bartender for 15 years so i'm always patient and friendly with bartenders and staff one bartender in particular always has a scowl on her face they act like you're bothering them when you order a drink i've even tipped great hoping they'd change their attitude but it's the same every time so i frequent bahama breeze where the bartenders are quick and friendly  this opinion is mostly for the bar outside on the sand it's a shame because the location is great i haven't been there in about 6 months but i've been going there for 6 years and it's been the same,negative
BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ,why is there so much hype around this place i don't know if people just care about the view so much they're willing to pay exuberant prices for below average food my friends and i went for lunch we ordered beer sangria and the berry moscow mule drinks  did not come until the end of our meali kid you not the server was nice enough to comp the drinks for that reason my friends didn't like the mule and sangria we ordered the corn and grab chowder garlic shrimp risotto coconut trip with risotto grouper with smashed potatoes and the pelican club it was a unanimous decision the corn crab chowder was the best tasting dish the shrimp risotto had way too much cheese my friend was barely able to take a couple of bites the  grouper was cooked well but had no flavor the pelican club came on stale bread you would buy off the shelve from a grocery store the free fresh bread was better quality and i wish my sandwich was made with it i could not get over how they piled the sandwich with mayo i ate most of my fries and less than 14 of the sandwich maybe it's a different quality on sunday brunches,negative
YEQk2NZM5TKqyqgo1rjFsg,wow this venue blew my mind in a bad way i really see a lot of room for improvement here the staff were not friendly at all the lack of customer service was so sad there was only one server for the whole bar area i felt so bad for her it took us over an hour to get our food and my order was messed up i specifically said i was vegetarian and they left the chicken in itthe only good thing was the arcade the games were awesome please staff your dining and bar areas better and please increase education on different dietary restrictions,negative
1Vo4BLw75ntATAJHYsxO3g,i come here over and over but it is only for the great outdoor patio and the views the outdoor waitstaff has always been great i've tried eating here many times and the food is not good poor quality and very basic i am not even a great cook and can cook better than this place,negative
h0z6-ExVdz-FkU02Dd4APw,my first time here and it certainly won't be my last everything was delicious and the experience was good tables are socially distant and servers wear mask the staff was friendly and our server kayla was great the food was fresh flavorful and cooked to perfection can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu,positive
kvOorg6F1gnbPmlTtjunsg,i had the pulled pork with mac and cheese  was really good the sweet potato side was tasty cinnamon and slightly sweet warm not hot tasted the banana bread pudding too it was delicious however the banana slices on top were kinda weird i've never had a baked sliced banana not mixed into something so it was brown and dry  would come again,positive
5TwBLv_xV0LawqkbIllEVg,if you're driving around looking for good food don't pass this hidden gem it is easy to miss but the selection of hawaiian favorites is great if you don't know what to choose definitely go with the big kahuna for a nice sampling,positive

pojLkG9I0ZJaNncNKqIEow,i went to tradewinds for the first time today it was terrific a real find in the heart of chestnut hill unlike some of the restaurants in this area its not pretentiousthe chef really can cook i had brunch the french toast with coconut syrup and bananas was excellent as was my wife's eggs benedict we will definitely try it again for brunch and for dinner,positive
pojLkG9I0ZJaNncNKqIEow,we stopped in on a whim and i'm so glad we did the food and the service were both outstanding and the food is reasonably priced my husband is a bit of a plainpicky eater and he loved everything he had  we will be back again,positive
0I9XZD7JTqY9iTF8nXRnXw,please tell me why i haven't eaten here before  do not be like me and go right now  i had just had my first poke bowl a few days before and i told my husband if i was going to get another one it was going to be from this 5 starrated place near iupui that i'd seen on yelp  i sold him  i don't think he'll go anywhere else  the service was so fantastic on a sunday at lunch time  we told them that we hadn't been there and she explained everything and there was a lot to explain  there are premade concoctions that you can do or just create your own  there are 2 sizes  the regular size is under 10 and it is plenty big enough  there are so many topping options  ok now i'm craving it and i know where i'm going for dinner,positive
0I9XZD7JTqY9iTF8nXRnXw,in short this is a place to grab a sushi salad they have great customer service and several choices in the things you can put into your bowl my goto protein is always shrimp and crab however i tried their marinated salmon and was very good i love loading my bowl up so i have put pretty much everything that is available in mine haha the sauces i would suggest would definitely be the eel sauce spicy mayo and crispy onions as a topping they have nice outdoor seating as well feeling spontaneous go try it out,positive
zhg9prrh_mc-mH5m1Vw7iw,i love a good taco this place has the yummiest kalua pork tacos i could eat at least a dozen all the tacos are great you can't go wrong with either of them the fried udon noodles are amazing i enjoy them with chicken but the tofu was my favorite they are pretty quick to get your order out for you the curb sidetake out is the only option you can do online ordering and you'd be in and out in no time their plate lunches are a great value and is loaded with whatever side you choose,positive
ghQGHlhzqK5CK-JkpCbt2w,my first time here and trying poke bowls loved it shoyu tuna was my favorite if you like ginger try there in house ginger that is freshly made also  there pineapple salsa is a great add on i would recommend it to anyone wanting to try something new,positive
CSRbFLgUDO1cvr3OlRMLHA,i used to not be a fan of poke or even raw fish at all until my boyfriend introduced me to pokeworks the salmon was very fresh and combined with a perfect amount of rice and toppings i did not feel uneasy eating knowing it was raw at all because the toppings made it taste so good and made me forget that it was even raw in the first place,positive
4Lh3RmIM3scml_9DOxY2Sw,i have been coming to kon tiki since 2007 when we first moved to tucson  being a fan of all thinks tiki i couldn't wait to come here  the decor is amazing  one of the best tiki bars that i have been too and i've been to a lot  the drinks some of them are good and they are very strong  the down side to kon tiki is the strange rules the food and the bartenders  1 there are certain drinks you can only have 2 of  but then they will let you drink what ever else you want  weird2 they have a dinning room area where you have to sit if you want to eat off the main menu  but you can't sit back there just to have drinks  even if it's standing room only  strange3  the food is terrible so get something to eat before you get there  ate dinner there the first time never again  i can't even begin to explain the horror  the apps you can order in the lounge are all frozen right out of the box  needs some work for sure  lots of revenue lost there4 the bartenders are the rudest people i have ever encountered  they all have a complex that they are the second coming of christ  wtf get over yourself you are just pouring drinks  i will still continue to go because of the atmosphere  the cocktail waitress are quick and friendly  i am never surprised when a new rule pops up or the bartenders are yelling at customer like they are second class citizens  it's kon tiki and thats just how they roll  aloha,positive

cPepkJeRMtHapc_b2Oe_dw,i've been waiting for this little place to open for awhile and i finally got a chance to swing in and give it a try  the menu is a mix of japanese standards with a faster food kind of take  the menu ranges from sushi to bowls with a healthy dose of standard fairs in between bubble teas are also available though i didn't try and of those todaymy lunch partner just wanted something small so he order miso soup with a few egg rolls  he said the miso was fantastic and he really enjoyed iti opted for a create your own bowl and was given a card to fill out with all my selections i ordered my bowl over mixed greens with korean beef bbq and teriyaki chicken pineapple mixed bell peppers cucumber sesame seeds with a light japanese mayo saucethe beef was phenomenal i loved it the chicken was really good as well overall the bowl was really delicious  the edamame was ok i should have done the meal option better if you pick a meal for an extra 3 you get several sides to choose from including the choice of a drink  potstickers soup egg rolls and other standards are all part of those optionsoverall i really enjoyed my meal though the price was a bit higher than i would like for the portion  i will definitely be returning to try more of their menu offerings,positive

6kGguKQkmMITO3n8H8EKOA,i was there sunday night 1 hour before they close i was impressed even this late at night  their food containers were still full of  fresh looking tuna salmon and all the ingredients the young employee built my poke bowl did a very good job he was also very polite and knowledgeable  about their products  he offered me a royal card collecting 10 stamps and get one poke bowl free which applied to all 4 poke fall locations in tampa i got a big fresh tasty reasonable price poke bowl and i did enjoy it after trying so many different poke places in tampa bay area  this poke falls is definitely  about average,positive

na6kPgbJ8c73JELysDrtuw,great place for a casual lunch i came with my boyfriend and we each got a poke bowl he got the spicy ahi tuna and i got the shoyu ahi tuna we both thought the shoyu bowl was better the sauce pairs well with the sweet onion that they add in the tuna was amazingly fresh  it melted in my mouthi ordered the regular bowl 1275 but wished i had  opted for the smaller bowl the poke while delicious got boring after i'd eaten half of it there's just fish and rice and not much else because they don't do toppings it was also really filling  even my boyfriend who eats huge portions said he felt really full afterward and we didn't have room to try anything else on the menu might come back sometime to try the other traditional hawaiian dishes and desserts the butter mochi looked pretty good,positive
djeYYE2MIT36obh5mcZn8A,this is now on our go to list  this is an pay make your own bowl kinda deli order style where you pick your options and they compile in front of you then find a spot to eat or take it to go concept restaurant    comes in large or regualr  pick a base  rice wonton chips or mix and match my pick 12 rice and 12 salad greens  pick your protein reg 3 scoops large 5 scoops sauce it  and then more topping choices  crab seaweed cucumbers onion shreds etcwe loved it and the staff was super nice too,positive

kvOorg6F1gnbPmlTtjunsg,i can't get enough of this place  great food and customer service is on point thank god it's about a 20 minute drive for me to go there or else i'd be eating there way too much,positive
HWrG_7G3lN_0TR5b3N5YWw,ordered 2 poke bowls for takeout and they were really good i ordered mine with 3 proteins but it only came with 2 which was disappointing i was going to let it slide but decided to call the restaurant and make them aware they were incredibly apologetic and refunded me the difference immediately between the bowl i ordered and the bowl i received the staff were very friendly the food was fresh and delicious and the customer service was excellent thank you,positive

EvdYKS6NVnU6J7emNJV2BQ,food was fresh  quality was good  i liked the choices and the ability to substitute  good covid precautions  good variety of nonraw choices for my landlubber family members  opportunity areas  portions are a little light for the price versus other poke places i've been and they double charged me for something and were confused when i asked for it to be removed  also we ordered mochi and it was 5 for three little ones  i think they'll sort all this out in time  we'll definitely go back,positive

J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,this was our second choice as the first choice was closed so glad it was i had the omelette with all the veggies and avocado the plaza with a pancake instead of toast wow so much flavor the coffee was very good too the service was excellent only asked for s milk after my food came coffee never went empty friendly and happy staff hard working  no one standing around and the kitchen had plenty of chatter going on that means they get along and like each other and their job  my hubby also had an omelette the piglet and was just as happy as i was the only downside is that we live in california,positive
djeYYE2MIT36obh5mcZn8A,i love how developed reno has become so many diverse food options are coming here which allows me to stay in my hometown rather than drive hundreds of miles for a specific restaurant poke king is certainly a blessing it's basically a chipotle for fish when you enter there's options such as your base protein sauce and then toppings for a regular bowl it's 11 and 15 for large bowl i got white rice salmon tuna and spicy mayo with diverse toppings it was sooo good and filling there are so many toppings to choose from and you can have as many as you'd like avocado is extra as usual the fish was fresh quality and so were the toppings definitely worth the price they also sell dessert which are a variety of ice cream macarons service and staff were very friendly and welcoming as well with fast service this place is small there are 2 benches and 2 outdoor tables so we had to get takeout since all the tables were taken their sign is a little hard to find but it's located right next to papa murphy's,positive

Qer4Xj5N2dYI1CnbKfdW3w,highest quality sushi bowl in the area have gone back and forth from fish bowl to here and you can not touch the quality and taste here fish bowl has upset my stomach after every meal and the fish had a odor to it every time never here it is more slightly more expensive and you don't get as much food as fish bowl but the taste is exceptional the fish doesn't smell and my stomach doesn't get upset,positive
7D5-a53BLau19RpMu-L3zg,fun atmosphere good service good drinks really really sweet drinks but hey it's a hawaiian themed place recently visited for the second time the first time was a while back so i don't remember much i do remember the food being pretty good so if you're looking for a place to try unique drinks and get some small plates this would be a good choice,positive
djeYYE2MIT36obh5mcZn8A,the poke was super good they were super nice and helpful on what to select to out in the poke bowl however the macaroon sandwiches were freezer burnt and not good it was a bummer to spend 12 to be disappointed at home don't let the macaroon sandwiches deter you from the poke they make the poke is  pretty good,positive
CSRbFLgUDO1cvr3OlRMLHA,a bit pricy didn't have anticipated ingredients but still met up to my expectations the employees were very fast and blew through a long line vet run quickly it also had a very modern looknow on to the food rice was fresh out of the oven when we got there ingredients were  mediocre to great but they also had a small guide to all their sauces which was very convenientoverall a very nice and convenient restaurant would go at again,positive
M4pf66QgBEu45FF_ivqk7g,this is probably my favorite place in the entire bay area for poke their food and customer service is top notch i recommend the golden hour and for those who love spicy food the ring of fire is delicious thank you to vivian josh and alvina for an amazing experience,positive
NBjZWsD9C-JwjsQ2mQlmNg,my group including 4 people with celiac disease arrived on monday to find the restaurant closed but the owner who was so darn tootin cute offered us all of her popovers along with macadamia dip she sent us on our way with full bellies and happy hearts ohana will always have a special place in our hearts,positive
na6kPgbJ8c73JELysDrtuw,excellent meal  i had the pork belly plate lunch  i honestly would of thought i was sitting in a cafe in honolulu if i wasn't in philly my partner had the poke and had the same reaction we have both spent time on oahu and i would say the food at poi dog is just as well prepared as many of the meals we ate during our travels to hawaii,positive
hoFiVWRR4t1wiEMq4FXWfA,i'd been here a long tine ago but maybe i forgot how absolutely delicious the food is one combo plate with short ribs teriyaki beef macaroni salad a salad with two fountain drinks for 21 it's worth it nicki helped us pick out what to get and let me just say she's super good with customers they have a gem to have her as an employee mamas also caters what a great idea to have an event catered by them i want to live here it's that good every bite was totally yummy this place is on my top ten in tucson nom thank you mama's,positive
qOrd_jWT3e16_wwRSpvYwQ,in a word awesome  there may not be a place like this in tampa bay with the hawaiian fusion and the food quality  the prices and portions are reasonable  you won't feel like napping after your meal here  look for the sushi roll with kobe beef  you won't be disappointedfor entrees i'd recommend the butterfish melts in your mouth or the surf and turf filet mignon and tiger shrimp  one of the better meals you'll have here in the tampa bay area,positive
rwd4rGpYxiCXvgMV49sYAw,it's taken me a while to write this review as i am having a hard time rating the place the wait staff deserves a five star review but while the food was fine and the atmosphere is pleasant it just doesn't come up to five stars i had the chorizo benedict and it was fine just not great wife had the crabmeat scramble and she loved it daughter had the french dip and thought that was okay nothing to write home aboutlili's is a breakfast place with a huge menu almost too big the prices are reasonable based on what you get i'm not adverse to coming back as it stands up to pretty much any other place in renosparks just a star short of being great,positive
bLnC1_-Kd_Z5qhHNQXCUfQ,texan here visiting for the weekend and my first stop in santa barbara was choppa poke i love the vibe where one side is poke and the other is shaved ice i ended up getting only the poke today the prices were a little higher than i'm used to especially with the small scoops of fish but the toppings and rice made the price worth it the fish were thick and fresh and the topping portions specifically the crab and seaweed salad were more than i expected which was great finished my bowl with a drizzle of wasabi mayo i would definitely come here again for a poke fix,positive
kvOorg6F1gnbPmlTtjunsg,super friendly service the bbq was terrific smells great from the minute you walk in nice to see some vegan options as well very unusual for a bbq place  the half meat sampler and grinder platter ended up being too much food for two but we did our best definitely will return,positive
USekrAG0-4tJUs9V2gBBOQ,fantastic place for hawaiian inspired food in dunedin cute place with great decor they have outside tables and inside with several different rooms just like an old house had the huli huli chicken on hawaiian roll shredded chicken spanish onion romaine lettuce tomato  jalapeno citrus aioli my friend had the dos tacos with mahi both were very tasty and flavorful they have a great beer selection too featuring aloha brewing beers among others parking available on the street as well as several parking lots around downtown right off main street in dunedin,positive
djeYYE2MIT36obh5mcZn8A,this is my first time going to a poke place and it was pretty good wasn't really what i expected but i would give it another try maybe i'll see if i can get the protein and the rice separate it's a small place but plenty of seats and the noise level isn't too bad,positive
6aUb_f9C7a2oOxaIfRGSdA,i love this place i've been going now for about two months almost every tuesday at lunchtime and i've tried almost everything on the menu you can't go wrong with the flavorsthe service and overall quality of the food that is just excellent last night we went with a large group for dinner and they went above and beyond to accommodate our large number i thought they did an amazing job and on top of that they gave us free brownies at the endgood job chicken in a barrel i believe that your quality of food and customer service is top notch,positive

yUpc_zF_lw_Fqi0gDTFwjQ,we have been to many sushi restaurants in the area including a couple of fancy big name places yet we always leave the other places wishing we had gone to akio we love everything about it from the romantic quaint ambience inside to the friendly service to the food we love that they offer takeout and byob the sushi always tastes very fresh we also love their miso soup edamame salad with ginger dressing tempura vegetables fried ice cream bubble tea japanese soda we've not had one thing we didn't like here everything is always extremely consistent and good in addition the restaurant's cleanliness is above average we will continue to return time and again and hope they never close,positive
M0NT6MBWg5-76wyQXMzJWg,not an expert on poke bowls but with this being my first experience i'd say it was pretty enjoyable i typically steer more towards a traditional sushi roll if i am craving seafood but the poke bowl is a unique way of enjoying some of your favorite parts of sushi mixed togethermy favorite part of this new experience is the almost unlimited options you get when making your bowl you start by choosing your base of either white rice or brown rice crispy wonton or salad greens and then you have your choice of protein i chose spicy tuna and salmon it was delicious with a good amount of spice choose of toppings and choice of dressings i love this option because i am all about trying new flavors and you can pretty much mix and match any of the options they provide with a few options having an upcharge pretty much what i'm saying with this is don't hold back go for all the flavors you want you won't regret itthe restaurant is pretty tiny however i believe there was only about 56 tables inside so it probably is not the best place for a large group i know this isn't something you can expect from all restaurants either but if you do have a little infant be warned they they do not have a changing table in their bathroom,positive
G15tUaO6G0nS41zY8g8Yow,clean restaurant fresh food decent quantities fairly priced stop by for a meal or snack clean bathrooms,positive

EvdYKS6NVnU6J7emNJV2BQ,very good poke bowls with fresh ingredients they have a variety of bowl options on the menu but you can also completely customize with a base of rice or salad protein of your choice including raw fish or cooked options many fresh toppings and various sauces i especially like the sriracha aioli and wasabi aioli sauces but all of the sauces are good this is a great place for lunch even if you're in a hurry as the staff does a great job of moving the orders along i'll admit that poke isn't normally my thing but my wife wanted to try this place and she loves it and now i enjoy poke very much we've tried several options in the area but poke bros has provided the best poke bowls and service in the area,positive
RluwogZeEmXzqEeJOho99A,cool spot in an odd but upcoming part of town  consgood luck with parking with all the construction around  we ended up parking on a grassy area about a block down  the train noise lol as it's passing literally right behind the bar  the bugs are pretty bad including flies and mosquitoes but they provide natural bug spray which is nice  other than that and i expect some of this will improve with time the place is cool as hell  great patio and all outsideno inside seating that i could see  we did not eat just went for cocktails but the food we saw at nearby tables looked spot on  drinks are great and a lot of cool concoctions for your try  loved the bartenders and staff as they were all super friendly and helpful with the menus  definitely will be back,positive

xAwES1JxVnoLmRPGrVu30Q,i'm always game to try something new and the ll hawaiian grill did not disappoint the menu was full of selections i can't wait to try including the famous big kahuna burger any pulp fiction fans out there but since it was saturday i decided to go big and try the lau lau barbecue pork and greens roasted inside what may be banana leaves served with kalua pork steamed rice and hawaiian macaroni salad it was different but tasted authentically polynesian and i quickly developed a taste for it especially with the side of teriyaki sauce that was included i will definitely be back to try their famous burger as we'll as some of the other menu items including the spam dishes,positive
bLnC1_-Kd_Z5qhHNQXCUfQ,really excellent food and service came midday with no other folks around and had a standard medium bowl everything was perfect the fish was obviously fresh and the veggies too ,positive

M4pf66QgBEu45FF_ivqk7g,i was really excited to try this place because i love sushi it was nice and clean and i liked the decor you can choose between a roll or a bowl for 12they have several different combinations available of which i tried the land and sea bowl it had two shrimp tempura chicken avocado kimchi and daikon i was excited to see kimchi but unfortunately it was a very watered down version of kimchi it was pretty good and very filling i also tried making my own roll with salmon seaweed avocado daikon fish eggs and they had a spicy and sweet sauce which was really good i put in on the side bc it was pretty spicy the roll was a little smaller portion so i wish the portion was a little bit bigger the employee who seemed like the owner was really nice and friendly unfortunately the employee who made my roll automatically just put white rice on my roll even though i wanted brown you get a choice of rice so he should have asked overall everything tasted good it was like the sushi version of chipotle and i liked how they have many different options for toppings and sauce if you like customization this is the place for you,positive
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,bomb local favorite always busy always worth the wait it has all the breakfast items one could ask for my biggest take away is no bellinis bloodys or mimosas,positive

wMmvlgv_-K2yLx1_IDobVw,gotta go not to far from the international mall we decided to try out this little poke restaurant and we were not disappointed while the location is probably not ideal the inside is cute quaint and a pop of color when compared to its surroundings the staff was young and cheery and made you feel welcome as soon as you walk intheir poke ingredients were plentiful and fresh unlike other places they held the food at a proper temperature and marinated properly the food was slightly more expensive than most poke places but at least they serve their food correctly meals were 1499 but we had plenty to pack into our bowls my sisters and i were extremely pleased as we try to visit every poke place we come by one of their highlights was their unique house seaweed salad it was unlike any other place i have ever visited and we were not disappointed,positive
URURwZcedT6sAXbeTuxgOA,heard a lot of good things abt this new restaurant so my wife and i decided to give it try we had reservations so we were seated almost immediately it was pretty crowded on a driday night so i recommend you make a reservation my wife ordered wine but i had the bourbon and blood and it was quite tasty the food was good we had the bourbon shrimp as an appetizer my wife ordered the salmon and i had the seafood boil with caribbean spice kudos to the chef overall it was a good experience,positive

4z0Tn9Vx_JvB2n3WGGWKuQ,i order poke ono for lunch veeerrry frequently it's so good you can tell that all of the toppings are extremely fresh if you've never had a poke bowl i would definitely encourage trying one from here they have something for everyone,positive
bLnC1_-Kd_Z5qhHNQXCUfQ,it's just poke honestly poke tastes the same everywhere to me it's good i guess for the random times i crave poke but that's like once every other month they don't really do anything to set themselves apart from competing businesses,positive
Rf-p0k0HpqtD7L4YBfWjPQ,this is my favorite poke spot  they have tons of toppings all of my favorites that some poke spots do not have the portion sizes for their protein is five star rating alone they put alot of protein in the bowls every bite filled with tuna or salmon i get a mix of sushi rice and salad ahi tuna and spicy salmon are my gotos the service is always fast and everyone is very friendly they also do reward cards so every time you go you get a hole punch and eventually a free bowl ,positive
3hlI68hS0pKFY6_rK5UU_g,i had the build your own poke bowl with tuna shrimp edamame seaweed avacado quinoa and kale with spicy mayo and it was delicious i will definitely be going back,positive
bmJgvpuf2GBXd62ELK0Q2w,luigi's is by far my favorite pizza place in fairmount besides the wide variety of delicious pizza they offer i also highly regard their other menu items here is a quick run down on some of my fave'spizza pie godfather loads of prosciutto ricotta cheese tomatoes pesto mozzarella  parmanother favorite pie that is veggie only caprese pizza  fresh mozzarella sliced tomatoes basil olive oil sp they offer a huge variety of slices if you are in the hood  looking for a slice i recommend stopping here over any joint on fairmountsalads grilled chix caesar for two it can last you a few days or the caprese salad similar to the above pizzahot subs chix parm favorite of the manfriend or meatball parm steak sandwiches buffalo chix cheese yummy hot sauce but ask for extra blue cheese on the sideme  the man typically do take out but it is also a great family place for sit down they serve dine in guest meals on plates with silver wear that gives it a restaurant feel can't decide on a slice they offer a basket of cut up slices that you can munch on while you decide who cares that they are cold  there freeoverall place is clean service is friendly  food is fresh  delishishness,positive
-3xX_IfttKjPJ792BOBJ-Q,yum i'm from hawaii so i've always been a fan of ll this reno location was perfect  the food was great  we all ordered beef short ribs kalbi plate and it was delicious  the customer service went above and beyond with our group of 12 during their lunch service  no complaints love it,positive
UdKHuxAAufKTxcfg0igk_g,great lunch spot in the center of wayne the atmosphere is very hawaiian and surfy feeling personally i love places that make the inside decorated and personalized met up with a friend and it was a perfect place to sit down and the food comes out fasti got the mahi tacos and the mojo chicken tacos and both are very delicious they are fresh ingredients and use corn tortillas gluten free the only downside i would say is that it is a little pricey for me a little over 8 for only 2 tacos while they are very good and fresh i have had better tacos for cheaper prices however with a location so close and being such a cool place to sit and chat i will still be coming back at some point,positive
3hlI68hS0pKFY6_rK5UU_g,i'm honestly not a big fan of all these poke bowl places that have been popping up i grew up in hawaii and have a bit of a purist view on poke most of the places nowadays are overdone complicated versions of my beloved pokei was pleasantly surprised here although the poke initially did not look appealing  it tasted fantastic the additional ingredients were well balanced and tasted great overalli'll definitely returnmahaloz,positive

7D5-a53BLau19RpMu-L3zg,45in case you haven't heard in the world of the people who make these things up the craft cocktail has been supplanted by the tiki drink punches you know the drinks that come with a metric ton of rum electric colors and an umbrella if you're lucky well those are your parents' tiki drinks this iteration are made with all the skill you have come to expect from artisan libations but the drinks themselves are so much more fun the dour mood once the purview of the whiskeyheavy craft cocktail has been replaced with the hidden joy that only sweet rum can bringi'm all inwhen i lived in new orleans never would i have imagined a place like beachbum berry's would exist much less on peters street but the crescent city has changed a lot since i lived on 2nd between prytania and st charles so i went with it and going with it is the right direction because not only can the folks at bbl's serve up a mean drink the powers that be are some of the chattiest friendliest you'll find in new orleans  and that's saying somethingsince i was in rome er new orleans um bbl 29 i went with the namesake drink the latitude 29 for 11 i received a magical concoction of passion fruit puree rum vanilla syrup orange pineapple and lemon i felt like i was cheating on the seriousness of drinking the l29 was delicious fun that made me happier with every sip  not just drunker happier if kids could drink this is what they'd drink and wasn't so much more of life simpler better easier and happier when you were a kid the owner himself waited on my group and served our drinks as we waited he pointed out the pool  and other fun parts of the building because we were there near closing time and were such a great fun group of benettonians he offered up blue hawaiian shots on the house you know how i am about blue drinks i didn't want to leave i may have wept a little as i crossed the threshold for sure beachbum berry's is going to be a permanent part of my new orleans rotation drinking should be fun not serious kick your feet up smile laugh loudly the tiki drink is back,positive
UnAvkWNib0F3lHtMwikt8Q,delicious fresh and friendly service lots of ingredients to choose from we got the salmontuna bowl,positive
hoYHhfn4w0mVjI60eHDHzA,i loved the poke bowl they allow for a lot of customization and you can get pretty much unlimited toppings but the serving is smaaalll i got the large and it definitely doesn't seem large but that could be just my perspective from spending too much time eating at american restaurants,positive
yUpc_zF_lw_Fqi0gDTFwjQ,i've been here twice and everyone i bring with me loves it here the food is amazing and the restaurant is nicely decorated the waiting staff is really friendly and one evening i came here with a large group just before closing and the chef gave us dessert on the housethere are plenty of options for vegetarians and many of my friends came back here after their first visit,positive
skY6r8WAkYqpV7_TxNm23w,i love this place great view great food great people johnny  mike make the best bloody mary's ever and they made the experience fun too i ordered the signature breakfast and signature bloody mary afterwards you can enjoy your day on the beach and you don't have the silly parking fees that i'm used to i live all the way in agoura and have decided that i need to come back at least 2 sundays a month although 4 would be ideal thanks guys my taste buds are still happy,positive

J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,food was really good service wasn't great at all didn't ask me if i needed a refill with my coffee but sure did ask my friend who was in my party waited a long time for my food but other people in my party got their food while i waited an additional 10 mins for mine  maybe i'll try another location  2 stars for the food,negative
skY6r8WAkYqpV7_TxNm23w,great location and views but that's pretty much the most i enjoyed when we went here  leave it to me to find the boathouse the one time i don't yelp and we ended up here mostly because of the view  honestly i felt a little cheated because we were shafted with an ourdoor seat that only had a view of the beach restrooms after we were told we'd get something outside for the sunsetthe food wasn't anything to really write home about either  i've seriously had a better seafood pasta in pomona lmafoservice was pretty average too  we kept asking for the heater to be turned on too and they just turned up the gas and not the heater,negative
bmJgvpuf2GBXd62ELK0Q2w,ordered chicken parm sub and cheesesteak because they were close  had to throw them out and i ordered from lazaros like i should've originally  blech,negative
skY6r8WAkYqpV7_TxNm23w,terrible food clam chowder was pasty and dull which solidified by the end of the 10 mins it took me to stop eating calamari was salty limp and crumbs were flaking off fish tacos were bland and rubbery do not get the lobster roll it tasted like tuna for the price of of lobster the lobster mac and cheese was a mistake disgusting fish in the fish and chips were old and oily fries were meh they'll lie to you about the michelada terrible food diner food at best i'm going back to quarantine i'm better off,negative
znsclI45kQcxk2dUUhcmng,i loved the salmon tacos at the other location this one i came into 30 minutes before closing and there was a group of people that followed in behind me the crew had pretty much finished closing the line by then they already dumped all the rice and when i sampled the poke it was honestly so bad i spit out both samples and got a drink to wash the taste out of my mouth the tacos were underwhelming which totally sucks because i got them months before at the location in reno and they were to die for and these were almost not good enough for me to even finish eating i was jazzed to have this near my house but i'd rather drive into down for a good salmon belly taco than come back here this place is supposed to be known for its quality and it did not hit the mark for me i understand the rush to close but there was at least 6 people that came in after me and as a business owner i would have been disappointed in my crew if i saw them throwing food out that could have been sold 30 minutes prior to closing raw fish is already risky to eat as is and i don't think i'll be returning here to take any chances again sorry ,negative
HP8kVUCXWR7m5S8GXSKh7g,i ordered grub hub from here so happy that there is a poke place near me with saying that it took over an hour to arrive would love to say good things but what my mom and i got from here looked nothing like the pictures the tuna had no flavor and the rice tasted like it had been sitting all day the description said there would be fried garlic and there was none just a pile of tuna and like 4 pieces of avocado,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,this one star goes to the pictures of the huevos rancheros i have seen a plain omelette with canned enchilada sauce is not huevos rancheros,negative
bmJgvpuf2GBXd62ELK0Q2w,horrible customer service their counter service personnel are extremely rude the manager or maybe even the owner i am unsure who exactly he is gives off the exact same rudeness each and every time i am in their establishment i make a point to say thank you after i pick up my order every time and almost always never receive a you're welcome back it is unfortunate because the food is somewhat good,negative
hvp1huVLVB7reZZKeXvhpg,never ever againwhere shall i start hmmmmm 1st let's talk about the dangerous parking situation there is enough parking for about 15 cars before you are literally parking on a dangerous and busy highway next let's talk about the wait that you have with reservations 45 minutes for a 6pm reservation now let's talk about the food it was okay for the pretty pennies that you pay for the foodwell let's just say it is sub par now our sweet little server was as kind as could be but acted like she was an indentured servant to the hulking behemoth of a owner after we had ordered and i was 34's if the way through my meal the sweet server said that there would be a three dollar surcharge for a substitution where i had chosen to have more of the less meaty and cheaper options she kindly asked if that was okay i politely told her that it was not okay when it was too late to change my mind she then told me that she would just pay for it out of her pocket which i said was absolutely not okay and that under no circumstances should she pay for this i told her that she needed to send her manager over when the manager came over she had the nerve to say that the server volunteered pay for it i said that it was ridiculous that you would even think of allowing someone who works for tips to pay for a ridiculous sursharge she said well you ordered extra shrimp which i had not i had given up steak skewers baby ribs and large bbq ribs for crab rangoon and wontons she had stated that egg rolls and the wontons were more expensive than the rangoon's what  then when we got the bill she tried to sneak in a 1200 surcharge onto my friends ticket for just sharing a plate but getting no extra food seriously  what happened to the customer being right or how about treated so poorly and being stolen from want to be screwed over come eat here  want to be treated like crap and argued with come eat here never ever again,negative
zhg9prrh_mc-mH5m1Vw7iw,the bbq chicken had zero sauce or flavor it was slimey and gross the mac salad and rice kept me full however the chicken really needed sauce and texture seems like it was boiled in water also the wait was concerning considering it was all premade and not even hot when i received it i will stick with l and leven though it's not that great,negative
kvOorg6F1gnbPmlTtjunsg,this place was very disappointing goodwood is so much better i wish i wouldn't have wasted my money,negative
7D5-a53BLau19RpMu-L3zg,i would definitely have to say the service in this restaurant towards our party was totally unacceptable to be in the french quarter nola not so fun employees and the food isn't worth the bad time my significant other's mood was ruined and if i could erase the entire experience i really would hopefully they learn from the experience because repeated business in the french quarter is how you make a name for yourself,negative
JzqY0fO-f1MhR6OXHv6__A,i can't believe the four people that ate their liked it i think these people either work there or no the employees or maybe even the boss as you see in the pictures that says best bacon cheeseburger in town well hell they've only been here for a month or so and  boise has not had their best of boise yet this year so i was wondering who voted best of boise  i asked that question to the counter person and she said the owner it got to like confidence  okay i'm game i ordered the bacon cheeseburger and fries fries are typical store bought crosscut fries fried in his fryer once not bad but standard the hamburger was definitely not the best bacon cheeseburger in town by a far the bun what's pretty good i have to admit but there was so much ketchup on it was coming out the sides and made it extremely messy two very small pieces of bacon that you can barely taste on a burger and shredded cabbage for lettuce the packout on bogus golden wheel fairview big bun overland fanci freez state street the viking on state street and westside drive in all have better bacon cheeseburgers buy a million miles,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,don't know what the hype is here but here goes i ordered the hawaiian breakfast rice was mushy but everything seemed just average  i asked for some fresh jalapeños but when i was about to eat it one was slimy and had mold gross  i also asked for side of fresh fruit also gross and did not eat it was old from 2 days ago it seemed  my husbands hash browns looked yummy so i had some but immediately spit it out it tasted spoiled almost vinegarymy husband ordered an omelet and it was not good it also tasted stale and flat not a fluffy omelette  they also used old bacon in iteverything tasted stale and ole we paid over 40 for breakfast  not good,negative
2h0D_jeKy81uZgpZGZmGPA,coming from a hawaiian and someone who is born and raised in hawaii this is not hawaiian bbq this is bbq but not hawaiian overall this place is okay what i'm not impressed with is the prices for their small portion sizes and labeling this as hawaiian bbq when it is not,negative
UdKHuxAAufKTxcfg0igk_g,it took a half hour to get our food pico de gallo was bland and the taco shells tasted store purchased disappointed,negative
zun6IVJa7wYe3wAPqWnPGw,had been wanting to try this place for a while based on the star rating and the pictures on postmates can you guess which pic is mine and which is the one they advertise with the bowl was so disappointing and didn't look a thing like what they advertise not to mention the price of the bowl for what i got portions where much smaller and the salmon had a strange taste to it it was drenched in soy sauce so much so that i had to pour some out to make it edible green bubble tea tastes chalky after reading more reviews i hope i don't get sick tonight i won't try a second time,negative
2h0D_jeKy81uZgpZGZmGPA,this place is terrible i lived in hawaii and in socal eating at legit hawaiian places and from home cooks and this place does not show the pride that exists in the food culture of the islands i tried a combination plate on two separate occasions to get a range of their food with miserable results i threw the food out could not finish it you know it's bad when even the rice is poor this place serves to college students who have limited options near ua will never return,negative
bLnC1_-Kd_Z5qhHNQXCUfQ,soo i came here for a quick bite to eat at the beach shoulda went to jersey mikes instead the service was horrid the girl helping me was talking to someone behind me kitchen anyway when she sprinkled the togadashi i indicated i wanted more well guess what tfb also i wanted tofu again not paying attention so i received scallops ok i don't have allergies so i suck it up but they were gross and tasted old guess they had to move em got s tiny portion of fake crab stuff plus when i asked questions about the sauces was met w a disdainful black stare wtf they really expect to stay in business really really total sucks fest save your  hit a nice anything else instead i've had better poke from whole foods santa clara  even the safeway where i live in the ghetto hollister so this place sucks that bad,negative
kvOorg6F1gnbPmlTtjunsg,don't order ahead there's no point called in an order half an hour ahead of my lunch break then had to wait 15 minutes once i got there ridiculous food tastes good and but the kitchen was having such a good time they must have forgot my order,negative
NUe39dKrCF8M6jGmP5manA,service seemed bothered to be there portions were a joke wasn't impressed with the sauce choices or the fact that you only get 5 toppings don't think they have them here but poke port blows this place out of the water i'll be looking for somewhere else to eat poke,negative
qOrd_jWT3e16_wwRSpvYwQ,came for our anniversary dinner tonight   the hostess didn't notate it was our anniversary when seated though i had notated it on our reservation and the normal placard identifying the day was not on our table  asked the hostess for black napkins as we had dark pants  she said we don't have any just the white  then we again asked the busboy  and he brought the black ones right away to our table   i noted to our waiter that there was a seasonal poke on the menu and asked him what was in that  he went on to explain what poke in general was to me  i stated i already knew that  but again wondered what was different with the seasonal version   he didn't know and said it's the standard when our food came we were swarmed by about 610 gnatsfruit flies flying around the table which was kind of disgusting we were seated inside booth by the windows asked our waiter for some soy sauce to go along with the rice dish  and never received it   reasked the bus boy after about 10 mins and he brought it right away the food itself was good but overall not a great nor nice evening  the busboy  assistant deserves 5 stars  kudos for efforts to make up for the other staff,negative
h0z6-ExVdz-FkU02Dd4APw,it is with a sad heart that i update my review and take a2z off my regular list of resturants i visit i cannot help but compare it to the last owners positivescoffee is good eggs are fluffy new owners are friendly i think thats about it the quality of the food is not as good it seems they wanted to keep things the same but change it just a little maybe like the potatoes they are still the same cut but i believe they are now fried in a fryer and are not seasoned like the others not really seasoned at all the gyro meat was suspiciously cut quite uniformly like they bought frozen slabs i highly doubt it was from a spit oh the tziki sauce was good forgot about that husband had the b and gs the gravy was definately not like it used to be but looked like they wanted it to beagain i was in love with the old a2z so the bar was set high i think it would have done them well to just to do a complete overhaul name menu the whole shabang i believe this may have removed the comparison issueif you have never eaten there it may work for you unfortunately it only makes my tastebuds mourn for the original a2z,negative
kvOorg6F1gnbPmlTtjunsg,i don't get it  why are they so highly rated  nice people for sure but by far the worst bbq joint in the boise area  are you kidding me  this must be their friends posting  the inside looks like a dump 70s diner  the pulled pork zero flavor  ribs zero flavor terrible dry and looks and feels like boiled meat and not smoked  again nice people but this is not bbq  sides are awful as well  on my worst day of bbqing i would smoke this place  bodacious in eagle and just about any place is far better  sorry but the food is no good and it has no connection to actual bbq  it reminded me of a buffet  i feel bad to tell the truth  we would never go back for any reason  shame on all of you bogus posterswow  what a nasty reply to my sincere comments  i even took the time to compliment the people  but the place is a dump and the food sucks  i means sucks  i did voice my comments and they offered to refund  i felt you needed the money more than i did  but no worries your reply makes me know that you know your food sucks  it looked like boiled ribs  sorry they suck  that is the nicest thing i can say  but i guess being honest is not what you want to hear  the people were much nicer than you  learn to cook and try again  if you eat here you hate real bbq,negative
cPepkJeRMtHapc_b2Oe_dw,i do not care for this restaurant my husband and i went on a weeknight and the service was pretty slow then i ordered sashimi and they brought nigiri instead when i finally flagged the waiter down again he took the whole platter because all of our sushi was on one large plate so we were stuck there starving until they fixed the one part of the whole ensemble,negative
xAwES1JxVnoLmRPGrVu30Q,5 stars for the staff at ll 4 stars for the sauces  but 2 for the foodi ordered the chicken katsu bowl  chicken katsu with rice the rice was super gummy and i couldn't really identify what part of the chicken that could have been used for the katsuvery long strange shapes also the macaroni salad was just a lot of mayo and macaroni noodlesno flavor except for all the mayonnaise,negative
hoFiVWRR4t1wiEMq4FXWfA,i used to love mamas about 9 years ago well i ordered over the weekend and let's just say i wanted an instant refund 30 for 2 meals and everything was so dry and cold ew i couldn't even finish it  30 down the drain will be my last time eating at a place i used to love i'd give negative stars if i could don't waste your money,negative
7D5-a53BLau19RpMu-L3zg,absolutely the worst customer service we experienced on our entire trip to nola  first of all this restaurant was attached to our hotel room and in our rooms it did say they did room service for the hotel  newsflash  they don't  they don't open until 4 pm which seems like a miss for day drinking especially at the pool  we decided one evening on our stay that we would grab a bite here before rolling out so we went down at 430 pm to be told that every table was reserved for the evening  we said can we sit at the bar and the male hostess told us that we could if one opened up  we went walking around to try to find food but the options in this area of french quarter are actually very limited  so as we are walking back still not finding anything we see that there is a seat at the bar so we go back in and i start to sit down when a female hostess says i can't sit there and again every seat is reserved  i explained what the male hostess said to me and she said that was wrong information  mind you 75 of this restaurant is empty right now despite them saying everything is taken  my sister then asked if we could order room service then and we were told that they were not doing room service that night oh so you just get to pick when you service the hotel in fact we came back around 930 to see if maybe it lessened up to grab a bite and was again told we are fully reserved for the evening and only about 4 tables actually had people in themwe actually became friends with some other hotel guests during our stay and he told us that he went into this restaurant to grab a togo drink for the parade and they made him actually sit down at the one stool open ask for a water show his vaccine card and then he could order  he was like i just want to get a drink real quick to go and they made such an ordeal out of it  meanwhile next door at the mexican place they had a table set up at the front window and serving out togo drinks left and right for parade goers  definitely seems like a money miss for this establishmentseriously though i was appalled by the way they treated potential customers and specifically hotel guests staying at bienville hotel because all they are doing is spoiling the reputation of the hoteland to note that place was never more than 50 full the entire night of their supposed fully booked reservation nightthe whole staff and establishment need to go back to customer service training,negative
mA6bD81rYVQWrjYPgYSiAw,seriously people have you no standards this place does not represent hawaii and puts no love in their food the teriyaki was horrible pre cooked and then reheated not marinated at all was dry and had a tiny drizzle of sauce that i know came out of a jar my friend was very disappointed in the curry i am a chef of 30 years and my friend is japanese hawaiian we know our shit,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,food is below average for a breakfast diner  large portions but lacks flavor no wifi,negative
0oyytCn4-fwXVqQ1aTgnVA,this place is horrible i got 2 items where rice was maine component and the rice was undercooked and left a weird taste in my mouth i got the garlic shrimp as well and there was maybe 6 tiny shrimp that was severely over cooked to where the garlic is burnt and black don't expect me to ever come back maybe the worst hawaiian bbq places i've had,negative
zXsv-tOEvtSMY755jt-uDw,not what i was expecting my family and i are new to florida and thought this place would give us a taste of hawaii but we were so wrong the food wasn't bad or anythingjust expecting something similar to ll in hawaii,negative
NNrhMxGS4yRD3FAim68xLg,i ordered thinking this would be like mo bettahs but this is pretty mediocre the katsu sauce taste like straight up bbq sauce the macaroni salad is sour not tasty at all im really hungry so thank you for the food but i will not eat here again i'll give it a 2since i took advantage of buy 1 get 1 free,negative
rwd4rGpYxiCXvgMV49sYAw,i was excited to get out of my midtown bubble and the 5 places one can get breakfast there my companion doesn't eat gluten and the yelp app and other reviewers seemed to show that there were options for those not digesting wheat the location is very large think mid 1990s chain restaurant large the menu also is a behemoth there were some hawaiian specialities and quite a few glutenfree offerings this excited me wherever i eat i will consume the moco loco if on the menu this one was quite underwhelming  gravy was bland and lacking in realgravy flavor the usually delightful sweet hawaiian style macaroni salad was a let down but the noodles were not over cooked like many are the hamburger patty was just a hamburger patty with something like montreal seasoning on it usually in my experience the patty is handformed and not so thin my partner was content with her gluten free waffle good texture not much taste the fruit that came on it was not fresh it was either frozen or canned the service was quick warm and friendly they have a big staff that seemed to use great teamwork to turn and burn the tables i am going to give it another try just have a feeling that at best it is going to be mediocre,negative
_UaTldka1sodVkg-pcNlZg,i don't usually leave reviews and i know times are weird during covid  but i have never ever in my life been treated as rudely as the manager on duty treated my group 11112020 after calling beforehand and confirming the number of people we had we were moved multiple times which is totally fine however where we were moving people were already sitting the manager on duty had the worst attitude of anyone i've ever seen rolling his eyes and basically saying he didn't care about our business he wouldn't let anyone speak kept talking rudely over everyone with a major attitude problem rolling his eyes and saying he didn't care about any of us to his employees sitting in the back corner gossiping like a high school it was my birthday and he was so rude my party completely left without ordering anything the host and waitress were both beyond sweet and no complaints but i personally will never go there again because of the horrible customer service unbelievable honestly feel bad for the owner  because i'm sure it's a nice bar outside of that poor display of a human being,negative
NXwEDLZjv8dUqbc5g5dCYg,oof this is a disappointment the fish is mediocre at best the topping options are slim compared to other poke places in philly the texture was way off the best part of the bowl was the rice the staff is super nice too that's the only redeeming quality  go elsewhere,negative

8L6t8H1zIHBftAmkPAIzEQ,this restaurant is one of many that tend to follow a patternadd sugar to a bunch of meat add a ton of carbs and a few vegetables and voila authentic insert ethnicity here cuisine rumbi is yet another chain that in many ways is matches costa vida cafe rio etc the formula is the same sweet pork teriyaki chicken  honey orange mixed with rice add a small amount of veggies load a plate with enough rice to feed a small vietnamese family and your have authentic island food the sauces taste like they came from gallon plastic jugs the meat tastes like it was emptied from food service bags the seasoning is just enough as to not offend the american palate this is massed produced sugar meat with basic roughage and rice when are idahoans going to stop paying into the pork swill franchises with their predictable menus and support real restaurateurs when we do we'll see more places like kahootz in meridian,negative
skY6r8WAkYqpV7_TxNm23w,absolutely worst service food and parking got sick from food and overall experienceread the one star reviews and you see a pattern  food illnesses dirty place rude staff unfair table seating acts and the list goes onsave your money and take your own food and drinks to the beach i got very ill from their fish and oysters it smelt a bit off too long of a wait for nothing special save your time and money so many other great restaurants in santa barbaraall the staff is college students but not well trained our severs whole butt was showing out from her shorts i was with my family she would turn to help the other table or walk around and her butt was showing maybe to get tips i don't know but this place is run worse than a fast food chaincovid rules were not followed tables were close to one another a random dog unleashed came in the restaurant and a boy picked him up bathroom was disgusting glass water bottle was filthy and had hard water all over it adam white is the owner of this and shellfish company in the sb pier do not give your money to either i ate at shellfish company and my friends and i all got got sick from the food the only reason either of his poorly run businesses are open is for the fact they are in tourist traps and they have zero competition near bythe severs and bar are pushing for you to buy drinks mixed drinks starting at 14 and very watered down they are illegally allowing people to buy alcoholic drinks at the bar and drink on the beach how can a restauranteur such as adam run businesses in a city that has outstanding service and restaurants with his poorly run locations he's really bringing down santa barbara's great and outstanding world renowned locations and overall reputation,negative
bLnC1_-Kd_Z5qhHNQXCUfQ,this review is only for the boba not the foodi had to give it 1 star because of a very bad experience i went here sometimes and i don't really like it the drinks're bland and the boba is not chewy today when i went here the guy who took our order was extremely rude to mehe wore a gold chain necklace i was just double check the size of what i order because it said large on the screen but i order an xlarge and usually the extra large doesn't charge me for the second topping but he charged me for it so i asked but he started yelling at me and asked me who told you that when i gave me the money he refused to give me the changes back and gave it to my husband i know the staffs there usually don't speak fluent english but even if they're frustrating they can't just yelling at the customer like that never go back here again,negative
EfYHJN8e-VRIfWyML19gSg,this place really needs some helporder after order as we were waiting to receive our food was incorrectone person cooking the food one at the registerwe have a group of ten people tonight5 of the 5 orders were not correct,negative
-3xX_IfttKjPJ792BOBJ-Q,worst place ever all locations ate there two years ago got food poisoning at there the other day and i'm just recovering again from food poisoning this place is a joke i mean if you knock off hawaiian bbq food this is the place to go this is one place i won't eat at again nor will i recommend it to anyone,negative
h2DidMy9Q9qyGlQ5xaecMA,the amount of fish that they give you is too little for the price that they charge  it would be good if they gave you more fish the scoop sizes are small and the people scooping the fish do not take the time to make sure that the scoop is even fullthe toppings are good but they basically sell a bowl full of fillers with very little fish,negative
zun6IVJa7wYe3wAPqWnPGw,i feel bad for lowering the rating but this place is the worst poke joint i've ever been to sure i'm not expecting california poke standards but pokedoke is worse than mediocre compared to places on both coasts and in between here we go the bowl is overpriced 10 for the smallest 3 scoops i've ever seen in my life they used what was essentially a teaspoonsized scooper i thought it was a joke initially when i saw the amount of fish scooped there's a miserable attempt to cover this up by immediately mixing the fish with miscellaneous stuff the fish was meh it was just bland and not that fresh at all if i wanted good fish i would go for sashimi at koi sushi right down the street or sapporo 2 on lindell  the add ons and sauce flavorings are fine and just that take a look at how small the serving is compared to the size of the bowl itself on the pic why even bother giving that size of a bowl then the boba may be even worse than the bowl which i also didn't think was possible take a look at the disgusting clumped boba in the pic on my third try there the boba was completely undercooked and hard if this place can't get boba right after 3 separate visits it doesn't deserve another try from meif you need some poke in your life do yourself a favor and go to blk mkt eats instead it's fusion if you care tastes darned good and actually gives a reasonable amount of fish,negative
1NpJcoks6ZtGKcE4Om_2Ig,super disappointed  used to visit this place regularly but not anymore  two times in a row we got a chicken sandwich that was so tough and overcooked it was not edible last week we skipped the chicken sandwich for obvious reasons and ordered the combo plate with mahi ribs and double veggies 18 with all the upcharges  the fish was ok but the ribs were more fat than meat but they did hit us with a 150 up charge  i reached out to them on fb a week ago about our last 3 visits and was told they would talk to the operations manager and get back to methey did not get back to me  never had an issue when eating in but this was take out and i guess quality control is not a priority for take out  i prefer to buy local but i think you get a companies true character when presented with adversity and instead of addressing it apologizing andor trying to make it right they avoided it  we will not be darkening their doors again,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,they are amazing at the mae anne location we decided to go to the sierra location since we were in that area where we had a awful experience i never send food back but when i got my eggs benedict it was full of water oozing out of the egg making everything watery and mushy i asked for another one if possible and he returned the same water soaked english muffin just with another egg on top awesome i tried to eat it but bread soaked in water isn't too appetizing i returned and said it's ok you don't have to remake it well as we were finishing up the manager of that location jody handed me a new plate and i was surprised when i went to tell her what had happened she ran over me and said people are only human people are only human she didn't listen to a word i attempted to say and walked off while repeating herself as if she was having a melt down i was only going to tell her i normally don't send food back and thanks for remaking i cannot believe the way she talked to me nor could my husband i will never go to that location again it's unfortunate  because we love pegs we will stick to mae anne where they are always so nice shame on you jody you shouldn't be in a customer service business if you cannot talk to people and hear them out and act respectfully we know it's a family owned business but would do much better if jody wasn't involved good luck,negative
skY6r8WAkYqpV7_TxNm23w,for those seeing this as the 1 restaurant under dog friendly they must have changed their rules or their current hostess just didn't want to do it but the do not accept dogs given the beach is the only off lease dog friendly beach it is and odd policy but be prepared bring your own or just go up the road but don't go here not dog friendly at all,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,the hash browns tasted weird stale and refried the eggs had no flavor not once did they refill my water they brought the check out without asking if we wanted anything else ended up leaving most my plate,negative
xAwES1JxVnoLmRPGrVu30Q,we tried this place because of a twenty dollar living social coupon  it lacks any kind of decor or charm and the floors were sticky  the board menu had absolutely no description of the unusually named menu items  we grabbed a menu titled take out and it also had no descriptions  we had to ask the single counter man about what was in several dishes such as loco moco katsu or bulgogi and had a hurried response  we chose the loco moco  two burgers topped with fried eggs brown gravy rice and a side salad which was a strange tasting macaroni salad the chicken katsu bowl  fried flattened chicken breast with steamed veggies and bbq sauce spam musubi and pork fries  after paying 2954 we picked the cleanest table which had to be wiped down with napkins wet from the drink machine  i had to scrub the sticky surface before i could even sit down  by the drink dispenser were three large unlabeled plastic squeeze bottles and small pill cup sized plastic containers  one had some kind of chunky bbq sauce another was soy and the third was empty  the food was served in foam takeout containers and katsu came in a plastic bowl  the food was served hot but that did not help  the moco loco had two grayish burgers topped with hard fried eggs a gluey brown gravy and macaroni salad all over white rice  shared with my hubby we both agreed that the macaroni salad tasted off and didn't meld at all with the rest of the dish  the katsu was a fried over cooked chicken patty cut into pieces and served with limp broccoli and a cup of teriyaki sauce i think  the pork fries was a mushy ground pork served on top of fries and squirted with an orange mayo and sirachua the musubi was a pierce of spam on rice wrapped with seaweed  the only redeeming part of the meal  we will not go back  we threw away almost everything after tasting it except the musubi  apparently it was a 29 dollar piece of spam,negative
PkBVbD3L0jCc9efVwJLwYA,went to the food court to get something else but this caught my eye since it was new and i always have to try everything at least once it's your typical menu you would see at ll hawaiian's bbq so it was easy for me to order the chicken katsu and one spam musubi about 11 and some change for my order and it came out pretty fast too took a bite out of the spam musubi and instantly spat it back out it was like biting into a brick of salt it was so salty that i couldn't eat it next the chicken katsu and i ordered the macaroni salad to go with it macaroni salad was very bland no flavor at all chicken katsu was over cooked hard and dry i'll give it another try since they did just open up but for now it's a hard pass,negative
c-0PoHHcA6k7y4CxjGH1jw,this place sadly didn't live up to all the hype i expected it seemed so exciting that there was going to be an outdoor tiki bar in center city come on tropics in the city sounds great well it was a short lived fantasy the bar is upstairs with both an indoor bar where the drinks are and a tiny outdoor patio now i won't hate on the size because it is the city so space is limited really the decor didn't live up all of the decorations look like they were purchased at the local dollar store cheap and tackythe service was meh and the drink prices were reasonable however this is a lame excuse for a tiki bar where are the crazy tropical drinks and fun coconut like mugs there is a another tiki place in northern liberties at first that didn't live up to the hype either but now in comparison i'd rather take the trip to nolibs for my tropical paradise needs,negative
skY6r8WAkYqpV7_TxNm23w,after 15 min of waiting at our table on the patio and not even being acknowledged we left ,negative
IpoUu-oHFFN8S9A1iUY2XA,i love poké and seek it out for lunch whenever possible  we were super excited to see this place just opened around the corner from our officewe got 6 people together to order bowls and called in our order and had a coworker pick it upwe were terribly disappointed  out of the 6 orders  only 2 of them were correct  the rest had all sorts of problemson two of them we ordered 3 proteins and only received two missing shrimp  they also left off the wasabi and pickled ginger plus didn't include the avocado that we paid 1 extra foron two of them they didn't add the tempura flakes or wonton crispsthey didn't include any forks or chopsticks or napkins for the to go order eitherif all that wasn't bad enough the food was bland  their poké sauce was weak and had almost no flavor at all and the rice didn't taste seasoned in the least bit  one of my coworkers ordered chicken and it was clearly from a can not grilled fresh at the restauranti know this place just opened but they have several other locations so they should know what they are doing  i won't be back for sure,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,servers not wearing mask no gloves nomask while preparing food  also no type of social distancing and keeping track of capacity is non existent if you don't care about your health and don't have the vaccine yet it's probably better not to come it's 2021 we've been at this pandemic for a year they should know better,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,so i will just start out by saying that i was severely disappointed at the fact that our waitress who seems to have what i would best guess is a russian accent seated two bald schmucks before me and my wife worse yet our table was supposedly ready but nobody cared to seat us right away the location is downtown and you have to eat as fast as possible which gives you no real time to actually enjoy the breakfast due to a 60 minute time constraint in the damned parking garage so you got that to fight as well as the extremely loud noisy people who don't know their own noise level of talking ok so the food arrives my wife ordered the veggie benedicts which i sampled and were delicious my plate on the other hand the spinachmushroomoniontomato omelette unacceptably bland oh yeah who makes a damned omelette with nothing inside have they never heard of cheese around here i blame myself for assuming a grander tasting omelette the toast that came with the plate mind you unlimited toast servings came on a plate colder than a corpse in a morgue also if you ask for butter which is supposed to be on the table yeah good luck spreading that butter on your already cold toast ok i have said my peace would come here again to reasses their service and food restrooms were clean on the guys' side,negative
xAwES1JxVnoLmRPGrVu30Q,came here on a sunday afternoon maybe 3 other tables seated besides us they were out of brown rice and fried rice cashier was not enthusiastic at all about describing menu items and had no insight to offer to firsttimers food came to the table in generic takeout boxes everything tasted like it came out of a frozen package and was heated up in the microwave from the fries to the veggies to the salsa  nothing tasted fresh veggies and fries had literally no seasonings chicken had weird texture the only reason they didn't get one star is that the place was reasonably clean,negative
qOrd_jWT3e16_wwRSpvYwQ,came here with my boyfriend to celebrate valentine's day our reservations were at 9pm and as we arrived we were notified they were behind on reservations after waiting a brief 15 minutes we were seated they had this great valentine's day menu which allowed you to choose an appetizer salad or soup entree and dessert what they didn't warn us about was the kitchen was behind as well after ordering the crispy chicken rolls my waiter decided to tell me 30 minutes later that they had ran out after two attempts they had to give me the only appetizer that was available 1030 rolls around and we had just received our appetizers which to say the least were unappetizing  it's currently 1120 and we had to ask our entree and dessert to go this was suppose to be an enjoyable dinner spending it with my loved one but it resulted into a nightmare we both left completely unsatisfied and will never return due to the unpleasant experience if you're planning on coming on a special occasionsave your time money and patiencego elsewhere,negative
zXsv-tOEvtSMY755jt-uDw,this place has good food but i went there for dinner tonight with my husband and he had to kill a roach that was climbing on his seat when i told the manager he took the napkin with the bug in it away and never came back he knew i didn't touch my food due to a cockroach being on the seat but he didn't offer to make it right or apologize or anything i'm so disgusted we will never go back,negative
gjHB6p19V_bS-R5lUZux4A,he does not serve traditional hawaiian food he serves hawaiian local style dishes that have an asian fusion twist if your expecting authentic hawaiian food you will be disappointed people never having been to hawaii will be under the impression that it is hawaiian food when it's not for example no local hawaiian restaurant would ever put hoisin or barbeque sauce on kalua pig this guy is korean selling what he calls hawaiian food when it's not other than that that his food is good i just dislike his advertising his asian food as hawaiian,negative
s_RStWu76oxfAPhmqmUMMw,this bar is extremely overpriced  all of the cocktails are over 10  that's really expensive considering how cheap the neighborhood is   there is a lot of booze in them but they are small  we paid 22 for a drink that was filled with alcohol  however it was so strong i couldn't even drink it  we've stopped here a few times at the end of the night when we were already drunk  it's really dark in here and often the music is so loud you have to scream  the bar doesn't really have any character  i feel like the bar is unsure in its own vibe and decor  it clearly wants to feel tropical and like a tiki bar but it has really loud music and is super dark  not worth the money,negative
UdKHuxAAufKTxcfg0igk_g,we liked it when they first opened but their service has deteriorated badly orders mixed up food not ready website that hasn't worked in months too bad because they could have built a following they'll be gone by the end of 2018,negative
-3xX_IfttKjPJ792BOBJ-Q,after calling the restaurant at 825pm and having the phone being picked up and immediately hung up i tried calling three more times to no one answering i drove to the restaurant to order in person even though it is a 15 minute drive for me since obviously i wasn't given the option to call in my order to be ready when i arrived only to be informed that they wouldn't make me what i wanted to order since they were closing in 10 minutes and the plate would take 15 minutes to make this is why i was calling to order it prior to my 15 minute drive the restaurant is still open as i am typing this but sadly they won't be getting my business or my money anymore the rude young man at the counter even acknowledged answering and hanging up the phone without even talking to me because they aren't supposed to take pick up orders over the phone 20 minutes prior to closing because people don't show up funny because i called more than 30 minutes prior to their scheduled closing time and was never given an opportunity to even order let alone be told about their 20 minute policy which isn't notated in their restaurant or their webpage most businesses work to make money not refuse service to people who are willing to use their business but i will never use their business ever again because of their rudeness and lack of willingness to do their job,negative
skY6r8WAkYqpV7_TxNm23w,the location is lovely and the staff was kind now for the reason of my one star 1 even though it wasn't crowded we had an epic long wait for our food 2 we asked for bread due to the absence of food but were told we would have to pay for it 3 we started with clam chowder which came cold and had to be sent back to be heated they gave each of us one tiny 12 oz of bag of oyster crackers 4 the caesar salad had no parmesan cheese and the romaine lettuce was yellow 5 on the bottom of the shrimp salad bowl was somebody's strands of hair after a complaint it was taken off the bill however it left that person with a nauseous feeling,negative
zXsv-tOEvtSMY755jt-uDw,not a great food or service experience this was on my list of pet friendly places to try in brandon  i situated my dog outside cleaned my very dirty table and chair and went in for a menu the host did ask me if i had been there before and i said no he did tell me just to come in and when i was ready i told him i had my dog outside and he said okay i decided on tacos it is what they are known for and went inside i wanted the killer and jimi churri we dont have cabbage i can put lettuce on it okay not really my back up was the baja nope also cabbage so i ordered the johhny utah and wipeout and asked for water for my dog he filled up a soda cup i asked for a small bowl he said he would look if you pet friendly have clean bowls or other options and when someone has their pet offer water he found a little to go styrofoam pint and that worked they brought the tacos to the table here ya go see ya i didn't have utensils so i scrapped the black corner off of my avocado and the black on the bottom i didnt know these were cold tacos the combinations are not very good cold the pork was a little chewy and cold mac  cheese not a plus there was way too much sauce on the wipeout and it left a peculiar after taste there was only one other patron at a high top a family finishing  up and a woman placing an order there were 4 staff here and they could have been a little more on the ball i hope the cabbage is in the truck that came and everything was prepped for the weekend because 3 out of four of your guys are out back hanging out i cannot recommend eating here  on a positive note the theme is beachy and this is florida yelpers check in for a shaved ice,negative
OR-MRrKXH4HKY7HggPbXwA,i don't like to leave bad reviews but my experience was pitiful i was so happy to see a place like this close by i ordered the ahi bowl  many pieces of the rice were hard  i had to  be careful picking around it not to bite a hard piece of rice and break a tooth the tuna was brownish  tried a chia bowl looked great was ok  made my stomach not so happy later  all for 35 plus tip had delivered,negative
2h0D_jeKy81uZgpZGZmGPA,today i had a hankering for some hawaiian barbecue so i decided to order mama's since i was feeding my girlfriend as well as myself i ordered two servings of kalua pork with french fries and macaroni salad the other with double french fries kalbi short ribs with macaroni salad and fries and a big kahuna plate during the order process i specified the gate code and requested that the restaurant 'drop' the fries in the fryer as close to the delivery departure as possibledue to the fact that their fries tend to be soggy by the time the food is delivered as i will explain later these requests and instructions were not heeded i even included a tip after placing my order online i received the confirmation and acknowledgement that the order was received by the restaurant with a time estimate of 45 minutes this was at 206 pmwaiting a while and slowly losing my patience i called mama's again at about 315 pm and was told 'we're running behind' so it would be approximately another 30 minutes before my food arrived as one could assume i was reasonably irked and debating why i spent my money at this establishment since their delivery estimate was so ridiculously understated finally my food arrived at approximately 330 pm i attempted to politely explain to the deliveryperson that time estimates and if she could please pass that on to her manager i was given a shrug and told 'it's not my fault or my job' after i went inside i checked my food for accuracy and i noticed that lo and behold every single order of fries was cold and sodden with moisture to the point of being inedible so i fed them to my two dogs  contacting mama's yet again i restrained myself from asking for a full refund and instead asked for a new order of fries about 20 minutes later these arrived in a paper bag surrounded with a plastic bag that was slick with oil and still soggy essentially i've given up calling them because i'll get the same low standard food or i'll have to wait another for some fries the only redeeming parts of this order are the kalua pork and the kalbi short ribs which were pretty good bottom line two stars i'm debating spending my money here again since  the quality control on a simple item is neglected not once but multiple times,negative
eR5dxMBiFXqQbv8Kego3FA,save your time and money skip the kanack locations at the boise plaza building i've taken back three meals in less than a year because they were inedible including breakfast today from the new kiosk not worth the trouble,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,per yelp it must be the best in reno but certainly just on par for sf standards  two of us had the breakfast sandwich omelette belgian waffles   portions are huge hash is done well  not too fond of the sandwich or omelette  flavors were light not bended well  i prefer the menu from squat  gobble better omelettes  belgian is floralheart shapped and taste good not too heavy but not very fluffy either 30 billalready a line at 1030am sunday quick 10mins wait  but immediately ordering the food wait was much longer at 2025mins  table turnover is quick reason for my table being cleaned out and almost kicked out of my seat before i signed the credit card bill waitresses are nice but not a very warmingfamily type of service  just quick and courteous  no small talk  no smile  for the price and food quality i'd probably bring my money to the buffet at the casinos try atlantis lunch buffet,negative
djeYYE2MIT36obh5mcZn8A,i've been wanting to try this place for a while now i've heard great things and the pictures looked amazing i was finally able to try it and i was super disappointed in the quality the portions are pretty decent and the fish seemed fresh enough the rice is what did it for me it was both watery and mushy and lacked the proper seasoning i figured they'd add some sort of vinegar or seasoning but it was bland i wouldn't have minded that as much if it had been cooked and handled properly i don't think i would recommend this place to others but if you're in the area you should definitely check it out for yourselves they have some neat toppings and desserts which i was unable to try since they were sold out still a great idea just poorly executed finbomb is a few dollars more but the quality is better  i think i'll stick with them,negative
NXwEDLZjv8dUqbc5g5dCYg,i love poke but the trend has hit philly hard and there are a lot of poke places in the city with even more popping up abunai was really nothing special and was a little disappointing compared to the other poke places in the city that i've hadthe fish did not look that fresh and i was a little concerned and almost didn't even order the tuna looked awful but the salmon looked ok so i went with that what i hated about the salmon was they left part of the skin on like they did a bad knife job cutting it it just seemed lazy and not up to the quality that i generally expect when being served raw fish they fill the bowl with basically 34 rice so it seems like a large portion but it's really just not they were out of multiple toppings even simple stuff like cilantro for a saturday night at dinner time it's not really acceptable overall the taste of everything was fine minus some of the salmon pieces unfortunately i wouldn't order here again and would go elsewhere for my poke cravings,negative
wKOD2ZWMpiJcdSswRXVuRA,walking in transports you to another place unfortunately it's not so much hawaii as it is like being in the food court of a giant mall in octhe fluorescent glow the orange walls the plastic tables and endless peter cetera piped through the speakersi knew we were in for a treat we kept calling it lol hawaiian bbqbut what to order my dining companion and i were absolutely clueless plus we'd left our brains at work so it was like dumb and dumber at the front counter mouths gaping staring over the cashier's head at the menu options i went with what i knew bbq meat and spamwow sugared meat for 8 i got a styrofoam box with two perfectly rounded scoops of rice a scoop of macaroni salad a layer of crunchy lettuce and cabbage and a pile of assorted bbq meat  i think it was chicken beef and pork the cashier said it was the most popular item ordered i can see why  it can feed me today tomorrow and the next but that was not all i really wanted some spam so i got the spam rice and eggs plate too two fat slices of fried spam two fried eggs two snowy white scoops of rice that could make a good breakfast and it was only 5 the eatery was sparsely filled with your assorted goletans slightly higher ratio of people sporting really big shorts and really big sideburns than i'd normally see in this town must be the iv influencecactus cooler seemed to be the beverage of choice because sugar juice goes really well with sugar meatnow i'm sitting back here at the office the food is sunken in my gut like that  treasure chest people put in their fish aquariums you know the ones that slowly fill with air until the lid bursts open and the bubbles frantically gurgle up to the top my dining companion ordered something with fried cabbage so i'm thinking his cube neighbors are suffering more than he isshout out to the cashier who brought our styrofoam boxes out to our table because we ordered in  mahalo,negative
eR5dxMBiFXqQbv8Kego3FA,tried for the first time today got a manini plate i had the park rice which is delicious and the mac salad standard as sides i ordered the katsu chicken as my entree i was told the katsu would need to be cooked in the back and it would be a few minutes i was ok with this since that meant i would get nice fresh food not so much the katsu looked like it had been premade and just redipped into a fryer before being served it was dry and severely over cooked and the portion was tiny  56 thin strips of chicken the restaurant was not busy when i went there were 4 people eating probably won't eat there again,negative
xAwES1JxVnoLmRPGrVu30Q,hawaiian restaurants are not common in the us especially in tennessee so when i found this hawaiian grill while hungry and browsing yelp i knew i needed to get some hawaiian grub i ordered a chicken katsu bowl reviews ravedddd about it and a hawaiian sun juice it was pretty crowded in here as it was a pretty small dining area and lunch time was packed with regulars there was a pretty wide variety of menu items but the chicken katsu seemed like a pretty safe betit was a bit confusing placing my order and the staff wasn't very helpful or welcoming when i came in after i placed my order i took a seat they were yelling orders out and sometimes taking food to the customers tableshence my confusion on the process of getting my food when i finally did get my food the wait is only about 1520 minutes it looked and tasted like frozen fried chickennot much seasoning plain rice and steamed veggiesthe sauce i guess was the hawaiian part but i really wasn't thoroughly impressed being of islander descent i was just disappointed by the lack of authenticy of it all but i did like the hawaiian sun which is always delicious easy parking and cleanliness,negative
SNKYs259mdKxiCdWd83U-w,i was so excited at first when i heard this place opened however soon after my visit i left the restaurant feeling disappointed  the service was mediocre the counter people busy flirting with each other in oppose to paying attention to customers  place was dirty and kitchen staff were sweeping and left all collected trash gathered at the corner  the dining room area floor had trash and napkins that were left i had ordered to go and the food took about 15 minutes  overall i would think twice before going to this place again,negative

qOrd_jWT3e16_wwRSpvYwQ,my 4th time here every time i hope for the best and am disappointed food is so average tried several dishes and they are all average go to eddy v's if you want good food  it's only a few feet away not only does the food suck but it's super expensive don't waste your time or money,negative
71b0dSgq1XTYYYWs24Fhow,first off i have had two great experiences here and have not minded paying what i think is a little pricey for a pokey bowl however this time was not the same i felt very awkward  when asked about the portions it seemed as though the different owners have different ideas on portion size this experience left half my bowl empty where as other times with the other owner my bowl was abundant with toppings it tastes great but my overall impression is too expensive,negative
h_D-p_m3diwqlAHQsOUjCA,originally would have given this restaurant one star upon arrival the place was trendy and seemed great and clean we ordered 2 beers and calamari the beers sat on the counter for about 5 mins getting warm while our waitress was nowhere to be found the calamari took 30 minutes to make its way to the table so that should have been the first red flag that it was over cooked the calamari was over cooked under seasoned and the smallest portion i've ever received the only reason they are getting two stars is due to the fact that they comped the calamari without us saying anything,negative
hTEuZm7Y3-Qg-5gkxSmfnA,i wanted to like this place i love poke and this spot is really close to my housei had a three scoop bowl with salmon yellowtail and spicy tuna the fish was okay nothing incredible but satisfactory in terms of freshness the portion size of the fish was small though  and i had hoped for more to fill out the bowl to feel like i am actually getting good bites of fish the remainder of the addin ingredients were fine no complaints there the sauces tasted okay but they don't really incorporate the sauce with the fishseafood as you usually see in pokethe rice however was really really bad some of it was soft as it should be but other parts it was hard and undercooked this really ruined the whole bowl particularly since much of the meal was actually rice rather than seafood or other ingredientsthe ordering system is bit of a pain and the atmosphere was terrible they play kpop music videos and the volume was super loud loud enough that it interferes with normal conversation and made me just want to leavemy wife's bowl had the same issues plus she got crab portions of which that were really bad and improperly thawed or somethingall in all this place seemed promising but i had a really bad meal i will probably not go back,negative
bmJgvpuf2GBXd62ELK0Q2w,i have had luigi's food a couple times now once delivery and once pickup and after giving it two chances i have to say i see no reason to eat here last night my husband and i got a cheesesteak and penne a la vodka to go the cheesesteak was so bland and flavorless and the bread was chewy and bland as well i would almost have wished it were greasier because at least then there may have been some flavor the fries it came with were soggy and flavorless as well the penne vodka was not a vodka sauce at all and tasted and looked more like a melted velveeta sauce it tasted nothing like what i expected the sauce was really thick and cheesycreamy in a suspect way the pasta was overdone the one time i got delivery i ordered their special blue pizza because i love pan pizzas it was really kind of soggy and greasy when it arrived after not very long i will give them that the crust was not what i would expect from a good pan pizza the pizza looks good for picking up a slice in store but overall i think there are better places in the neighborhood with similar menus pete's cheesesteak was much better and fairmount pizza was far more flavorful,negative
fQknpOKcW_JtfE6oIoGkKg,service is terrible they basically stole my money nobody made my food even though i ordered through the app i arrive the person who is designated to make my food dismissed my order because the system didn't print it out and just kept moving on as if i hadn't been standing there i had to push for my order i would not have gotten it only to find out what i ordered could not be madephoung is rude a dismissive i was understanding that everyone was under pressure and i was calm spent 30 minutes there and left without my order and without my moneyupdating review next day after the incident i have been issued a refund and a credit on the app as an apology i had left my phone number to be reached by janet yesterday and did not get the call i was messaged on yelp to resolve the issue,negative
2h0D_jeKy81uZgpZGZmGPA,i ordered the pork lunch plate with rice and macaroni salad talk about bland and dry even the hawaiian rolls were bland not even home made but store bought could only tolerate the macaroni salad i won't be going here again,negative
rwd4rGpYxiCXvgMV49sYAw,please update hours to reflect when you close at 3 pm thank you  it really sucks when we arrive people are eating and then you state you are closed,negative
skY6r8WAkYqpV7_TxNm23w,the few times that we have been here the service is always lacking the hostesses are always rude ordered one of their specialty drinks off the menu it was horrible tasted like furniture polish ordered lobster mac  cheese it had a hair in it it looked watery only thing that is good about this place is the view if you sit outside if you want the view you're better off just picking up food from elsewhere and sitting on the beach then wasting your time or money here,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,this was the third time i've eaten at peg's first time last summer was the best omelette i've ever had and posted it on yelp with a pic and gave them 5 stars second time i ate there at the end of last summer and the same omelette was mediocre but i chalked it up to they were having a bad day  now 6 months later same omelette and one of the worst i've ever had so so disappointed  either the waitress or the cook mixed up my request for extra tomatoes and made it extra ham at least 7 mins went by before our waitress came to check on us btw we tried to get other waitresses or employees attention so i could have my omelette 'fixed' but we were ignored by the time our waitress came to check my husband had already consumed more than half his breakfast and we didn't have the time for a redo on mine the omelette that was served to me had watery greasy fluid under the entire omelette and most of the under cooked hash browns the only reason i gave a 2 star instead of 1 is because my husband's breakfast was ok but how difficult is it to screw up scrambled eggs sausage and toast i'm sure it can be done i'm very disappointed and bummed because peg's is across from my hotel when i come to reno for business and i've recommended it to colleagues now i'm embarrassed that i recommended it and now will advise my colleagues about the unfortunate decline of a once promising breakfast establishment,negative
NNrhMxGS4yRD3FAim68xLg,i ordered the katsu plate and it didn't come with any katsu sauce so it was dry af and my first bite i had to pull a piece of wood out of my mouth i tried to call the number listed on google to talk to someone but the number is out of service i just decided to throw the whole meal away i work in healthcare and i eat way too fast to examine each bite lol it's not worth ingesting something non edible i wish their number worked would love to talk to someone about this basically just threw away 20,negative
3hlI68hS0pKFY6_rK5UU_g,terrible customer service only put one of two bowls into the bag for uber eats delivery despite the fact that the bag was tied shut with my name on it they blamed uber eats for messing up the delivery when we contacted them to fix the delivery they blew us off,negative
CSRbFLgUDO1cvr3OlRMLHA,i'm a little bit disappointed that my food was underportioned and didn't taste very fresh i usually order poke from here because their poke bowls are very delicious and usually fills to the top of the bowls however when i received my order today and opened the bag i noticed that the poke itself was portioned very little as well as the sushi rice also tastewise some parts of the sushi rice was hard as if it wasn't cooked thoroughly and the ahi tuna did not taste fresh this time i hate leaving negative reviews and i come here many times to grab lunch and they never disappoint but today i was pretty upset that this was what i got after paying 12 plus taxes and delivery fees i will think twice about coming here next time,negative
qOrd_jWT3e16_wwRSpvYwQ,i've been to roy's before and had some really great experiences this time was truly disappointing though first it was mother's day so it was a special occasion we arrived to find a pared down mother's day menu which our waiter said they implemented that morning so no prior notice on that regardless we all could find something to eat on the menu even if it wasn't all our favorites  but the service this evening was awful maybe our server was overloaded or understaffed but after he took our order we didn't see him once for almost an hour they forgot the quesadillas for the kids entirely and the food took a really long time to come out a food runner brought the dishes the waiter never checked on us water glasses ran empty and it was downright awkward how long we sat there waiting with empty or halffinished plates my leftovers were ice cold by the time i could get a box for them and the kicker was that we had a 25 gift card but when the check came they told us it couldn't be used on mother's day i read all the fine print there's no indication it can't be used on any holiday overall a really poor showing from what i've always considered an above average restaurant,negative
ls4-Q1KYVP7L6H4eMTQx4w,my husband and tried this place today i was not impressed  i ordered the basic burger 825 my husband ordered a greek isle burger sorry i forget the cost of that around 11 i think  we both ordered our burgers 'medium' mine was so overcooked and dried out that it basically had no flavor it was quite frankly one of the worst pieces of meat i have had in a very long time the bun was dried out and the bottom of the bun broke in half when i picked up the burger the fries are battered in something i consider that unnecessary and unappealing  my husband's burger came with thick potato chips which were better tasting than my fries  his burger was not immolated like mine and was served on a bread that looked like focaccia it had a huge red pepper on the bun and some feta cheese i think it was feta  he ordered a draft ale i had a soda neither of which were bargains his ale was 550 my soda was 275  the wait person asked if i wanted more soda and was quick to add that they don't provide free refillsi won't be back with tip this adventure cost me 32 i honestly don't think it was worth 12 of that,negative
na6kPgbJ8c73JELysDrtuw,to inform the casual philly poke eaters the poke here is literally just fish on top of rice and their large bowl is still teeny tiny with 80 of the bowl being rice for legit almost fifteen dollars see my pictures for evidence honestly i was so surprised that i had to check in with them asking if they hadn't accidentally given me the smaller bowl they responded with annoyance saying that it's got so many grams of fish in it but i all i could see was rice i genuinely did not know i was legit just getting fish and rice and so much rice too the worst part was how the person behind the counter made me feel so ignorant and was irritated at my shock at what she presented to me i understand maybe i should have somehow known that this place gave out original hawaiian poke rather than the other types of poke that most other places in philly serves really they should note that in their delivery app and maybe their other snacks are good but felt that service was unnecessarily inconsiderate and that i would have rather spent my money elsewhere personally i definitely recommend just going down the block to wiki poke or poke spot or pokeworks instead,negative
KQnzEi-xfHlqUIRUZByTvw,staff was nasty my daughter couldn't leave her puppy on the street so she was holding her just to order we were planning to eat outside the staff asked us to leave so we ordered separately with my wife holding the puppy outside while i was ordering another customer stepped closer to the menu and staff told him to step back because he was standing slightly behind the counter to read the menu very rudefood was ok we will not be backvery disappointing and i asked to go there for father's day,negative
iG_V7yA5qDrluSOr2HOSDQ,went out for some late night food i ordered 2 regular plates of the traditional huli huli chicken however this time i had asked for double mac on one of the plates and as i was finishing my food i hadn't noticed that this was in one of the scoops of mac this is the second time this has happened last time was a beard hair hawaiian time please wear hairnets,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,came to visit on a sunday morning there was a wait 30 minutes there is a lot going on our waiter was also seating people cleaning tables communicating with the cook across the room so it is extremely loud and that also creates some other issues if you're handling clean utensils and cups you probably shouldn't be handling a dirty rag with cleaning product we ordered short stack macaroni salad orange juice turkey patty egg whites and hash browns i was super happy to see the turkey patty optionthe orange juice was fresh squeezed and delicious the turkey patty hash browns eggs and macaroni salad was just okay the pancakes were not goodwe won't be back a few additional tips that i have learned in the pandemic but are great to incorporate beyond the pandemic the multiuse condiment days are over the containers were sticky invest in single use packets of salt pepper sugar ketchup hot sauce etc also try adding vanilla creamer,negative
FBqYnP7H3TMHYQvafuBTSA,really great service from madison t i normally do like hiwi love their burger and musubis however i ordered a large teriyaki plate with half fish and half eggplant and i was pretty disappointed with the portions it was literally 2 slices of eggplant and 1 piece of kinda overdone fish for 9 my friends have had good experiences with the fish before so i think this means they need to work on their consistency  i think hana is more consistent cheaper and a better value as they have better proportions,negative
EfYHJN8e-VRIfWyML19gSg,guy fieri said it was good even the sign said it but it was extra gross with no taste they need to learn how to season there food all of it from chicken to beef not my cup of tea,negative
M4pf66QgBEu45FF_ivqk7g,very disappointed every time i order food from here via a food delivery service not sitting in house the food sucks tonight i paid for burnt rice if the rice was bad why not give me another option now i've spent 40 on two bowls that we had to trash waste of money,negative
HP8kVUCXWR7m5S8GXSKh7g,i suspect that that i got food poisoning from eating at this restaurant stopped in for takeout last tuesday 972021 within 24hrs i was very sick with all the usual symptoms of food poisoning and i am still on the mend,negative
J0joPXxmN-_9Lzafspqdbw,last time i was here and had heuvos ranchero and it was awesome  this time the crab benedict which is on par with most casino buffet like the island in peppermill soggy bottom non tasteful crab cakes that was mostly mush vs something i expect a cut above was a real downer  wish it was much better and not something that taste like it sat around for agesworse it came out violently 1 hour afterwards the service is always good but i come when it's not a mob scene really want to support family establishments like thisbut they have got to make the customer proposition e not to forget too and differentiate to be a cut above the rest  for the price i paid i would have rather eaten at the buffet on this trip,negative
7WeUYhZ7sP73mBLZwboglw,i will never return to mama's hawaiian barbcue because of the following issuespoor customer servicewe waited forty five minutes in the nearly empty restaurant for two dinner plates to arrive that is an inexcusably slow pace and to make matters worse no explanation or apology was offered for this delayquality and tastethe kalua pork was soaked in salty cooking water and the bbq sauce was not sweet at all as one would expect  it was also extremely salty that is both of these items were salty to the point of being inedible the white rice had clearly sat in water all night and was steamed then steamed again and again so that once it reached the plate it was no longer rice but had transformed into two blobs of tapiocalike paste in addition the teriyaki chicken was simply grilled chicken that was dry when i order teriyaki chicken i expect grilled chicken that was marinated and basted in teriyaki sauce as it was cooked not plain chicken with teriyaki sauce on the table perhaps renaming this dish is in order i will admit though the costco frozen bagged resteamed vegetables were ediblepricethe price of this atrocious meal was surprisingly expensive for less than mediocre quality food and ingredients,negative
Ps8KgiyJhPqhkjWBklPimg,i am updating a previous yelp review where i gave one star i just came in and the service and food was so much better than we previously had there were different servers and the difference was noticed i will come and eat here more often if they continue to get better,positive

HvBLY3-R1KxocZapeAAvZQ,omgthis is one of my new favorite restaurants in nashville we did not have a reservation and they still sat us immediately on a friday night the service was professional and prompt our server even went through the menu and pointed out all the things available to a person in our party who was lactose and gluten intolerant the food omg the food was so good lots of veggie options and absolutely delicious we will most certainly be back well done,positive
ezB8e2rijjViprrcTdIiQQ,love this place a tampa institution been eating here since 1998 and food is great and cafe con leche is the best,positive
PQYuPr2Dfm2S49EULjl1qw,off the main strip quaint i will say the average plate is 13 dollars and goes up from there no kids menu to be seen and when asked chicken tenders was the only option server was nice but spoke very little english ordering was a challenge the place is clean and bright and smells fantastic like grilled meats and chimichurri it wasn't to crowded for a sunday afternoon it could seat max 70 people and the tables are very close together parking wasn't bad but i can see how it could be a challenge on a busy day drinks come in a can and you pour into a glass over ice didn't care for that cause refills are not free the bread was fresh warm and tasted great the chimichurri came out and was slightly spicy and very different from the tangy sour stuff i have had in the past but nonetheless was very flavorful when the food came is was nicely presented and it was a ton of food the blood sausage short ribs pig cheeks pork chops omgeez amazing especially with chimichurri over top the food was very good for the price i would come back my wife and kids enjoyed it thoroughly i recommend this place to anyone looking for decent argentinian food service is a bit slow but worth the wait just don't order a burger order the south american food and you will be happy,positive
S8ZFYEgMejpChID8tzKo9A,yum scrum amada i love this place mainly for its atmosphere decor and drinks staff are friendly and knowledgable too overall i think the food is good however serving patatas bravas as they do is strange at best i wish they were more authentic that said it's my only gripe i regularly eat here and have no doubt i'll continue to do so,positive
KSYONgGtrK0nKXfroB-bwg,it's so good the service ambiance selection of wines cocktails and tapas divine the pulpo was the best i've ever had and the simple salad was anything but simple a little pricey but worth it enjoy,positive
nrep-epDhpYB3bDCVGdIag,my wife and i stopped in to vida and were pleasantly surprised we came in on a tuesday  one of the specials they offer is a mix  match taco selection we sampled just about all the taco options the highlights were the short rib taco and the blackened shrimp taco the short rib taco recently claimed top honors in a recent delco competition and we can see why one of the owners bill introduced himself and wanted to hear how we liked the offerings they are building a following for american fusion with a latin influence the flavors jumped out the freshness was evident and we received friendly service overall an excellent experience when we are in havertown we know where to stop in,positive
PN5XfZbqf1SI1mZBYSJzVA,amazing service tapas and dessert were amazing the cocktail i had was perfect loved the vibe and reasonable price ,positive

089KGIJDnVJEAe3GiXzlrQ,such an awesome place the owners are very friendly even though it was my first time there they treated me like a regular the owners go above and beyond to make the customer feel at home it was honestly like i just walked into a friends house and sat down for breakfasti got the bct breakfast sandwich and a flatwhitesomethingorothercoffee obviously not a coffee connoisseur here lol that was really good then one of the owners i'm assuming and i get into a conversation about the airopress french press coffee and he gave me a tutorial on how to use it seriously some awesome people here and plan to become a regularupdatebeen coming here for a while now and still love  the breakfast and brunch on saturday's is very good came with my sister who has an egg allergy and they had eggless pancakes anyone who is vegan or allergic to eggs knows how hard it is to find a place that serves eggless pancakes but they did and they were amazing i had the stuffed french toast and bruschetta both of which were delicious update decided to try lunch today and got the skinny tampa bowl basically it's mojo marinated chicken over the house salad it wasn't bad the salad was fresh and veggies were good i just wish the chicken had a little more flavor i think the original tampa bowl mojo pork and black beans over rice would have been better,positive
3YqUe2FTCQr0pPVK8oCv6Q,i'd like to share the text i sent my best friend  slash boyfriend while i was herehi sweetie i'm still at the restaurant  but i had to take a moment to text you real quick you'd love this place it's rich in history been here since 1905 family owned and operated the floor is an earthy tile with dragons  and family crests  patterned like a woven throw the tapestries are both deep  and humorous if you take the time to notice and the staff welcomes you like family i put my trust into the hands of carlos my big smiled waiter  and he knowsthis menu because he did not do me wrong i had a charred calamari with lemon  that i polished off with a porcelain  barreled chardonnay the had a new york steak  with potatoes and mushrooms stuffed with perfection there is a house sauce over this steak that is indescribable so i won't offend it by tryingand he paired it perfectly with a red wine that has just enough sweetness and dryness to compliment the garlicy rustic flavors of my entree  i'm glad i'm here alone because there's no one else i'd share this moment with you are the only missing factor the dancers were phenomenal and i'm having a great time i won't lie but still i'd rather be with you i miss you and truly love you we're coming down soon i don't care if it's just for a weekend btw i polished it off currently with coconut ice cream white chocolate bread pudding better than it sounds and of course a glass of champagne  perfection thank you carlos,positive
dT19ZJyw9o5VUr6MhoA07Q,since i arrived fashionably late for this dinner there was a mediterranean flatbread already on the table quite the warm welcoming it took me a solid five minutes to scour the amazing menu and we as a group of four decided to share several items we started with the insalada isabella and iceberg wedge the wedge was fantastic and had two orders of grilled octopus come out soon when i say that the octopus was the best thing i've eaten in months i am not kidding and i am not lying when i say i could eat that dish every single day for main courses we shared the filet grilled langostinos and gnocchi there was not a single weak dish amongst the three and it was enjoyable passing all three around for sampling may have come my way several times the filet was cooked well and the spinach really paired well with the meat the langostinos may have been a smaller portion than i was expecting but that saffron rice was delicious finally the gnocchi  was a fine fine dish i need not say more except it's the perfect dish for a chilly night having a funny waitress and a couple of bottles of sean minor cab didn't hurt the experience here and i look forward to my next visit here if i ever make it out of the city again,positive
ezB8e2rijjViprrcTdIiQQ,open all night so who can complain they don't have everything on the menu at a given time but what they do have is really good friendly and fast service say hello to little guy for me,positive
5X43mcuo8-oq9NUZi5m7Jg,i've been to mojito cuba caribe twice both times under different ownership the first time was under a funny dude name mickey he was great and had wonderful stories to tell the food then is a different story portions were a tad bit small for the prices they charged i came back last week with family and under the new owners the food has improved drastically in my opinionwe started off with some mango mojitos and beers they have a few select ipa's on special and their mango mojitos were amazing we ordered a sizzling grilled chicken fajita and pan de lechon which consist of roast pork mojo cilantro mayonnaise and grilled onions on pressed cuban bread the roast pork sandwich was very juicy and tender the cilantro mayonnaise along with the onions went really well on that toasty cuban bread as for the fajitas they sure came out sizzling many other patrons ordered it because it smelled so good whenever the waiter passed by with it it was really worth it served with grilled onions bell peppers rice and beans guacamole sour cream and warm tortillas it was very filling and one of these best things to eat in all of main street in new hopeverdict  mojito cuba caribe is a nice cozy fancy little joint there's outdoor seating and the service here does not disappoint i miss the mick but the food under the current owners is way better than before everything is speedier and tastier job well done,positive
S8ZFYEgMejpChID8tzKo9A,absolutely delicious food great ambiance in the restaurant great bar  the only downside i can think of is that it's in olde city which i try to avoid but other than that pretty much fantastic in every way  i recommend doing one of the tasting menu options and letting your server and the chef make the decisions for you  that way you get to try all the best things and things you wouldn't normally choose for yourself  every course that came to the table was amazing  i particularly loved the selection of cheeses the chorizo and the lamb  the only thing i would do differently is order fewer dishes so that i could more fully enjoy dessert  56 dishes for two people would be plenty,positive
9uRj85PviKNiMCYPwiJyIw,delicious food got the 12 salad 12 cuban perfect combo cuban bread is brought to you after you order it's hot and the perfect taste view of the riverwalk is nice as well perfect lunch spot or date night,positive

3YqUe2FTCQr0pPVK8oCv6Q,we had a large family lunch here after my sister's wedding rehearsal  a huge historic structure houses this restaurant and it took them a minute to find a table large enough to accommodate the 15 of us even though we had a reservationthey started us off with bread and we quickly ordered a couple of tablesidemade pitchers of sangria  they were delicious especially with the secret ingredient  brandy  refreshing for sure they also offer a white wine version but we prefer the redi stared off with a cup of spanish bean soup which was highly addictive but i wanted to pace myself for the other dishes to come  the famous 1905 salad was similar to a cobb salad and the dressing was mild but tangy  the cuban sandwich was filling and a bit too bready but it had all the right flavors  my wife's saltedado chorizo yellow rice and grilled vegetables was the best meal we trieda very satisfying and authentic meal that everyone enjoyed,positive

S8ZFYEgMejpChID8tzKo9A,was visiting philly and had to try one of my friends favorite spoti love the dark interior service was impeccable our server was the best we did the 55 tasting menu and a glass of red sangria  if it is in the details this place got it down to the note like the cinnamon stick in the sangria which brought a wonderful aromathe dishes that followed did not disappoint the octopus was wonderfully tender but slightly charred the lamb chop with feta was a sensational hit my only gripe the last two dishes i felt were a bit over saltedthe scallops and potatoesoverall it was a wonderful experience that i would love to come back to again,positive

_EwuYl6cv4td1Mud68U-qg,being a ny'er i love empanadas and the one in ny with the same name i looked for one near me and this is the closest although not connected to the one in ny in any way i have been meaning to try this place for months even though they are almost an hour away i finally made it there yesterday and was taken aback by the crowded small establishment they were very small but it was ran like a well oiled ship my daughter and i both ordered a box of 6 the ba beef sausage and pepper onion and pineapple had to be our favorites i can see taking the trip out to this place once a week the crust was flaky and soft and the fillings were flavorful i hope they will try a shrimp one as that is my favorite from the other place in ny,positive
l_NqE_IHW79Ka-yd6FkQaQ,the food is awesome and the bar is great make sure to see danny at the bar and ask for his personal recipe margarita as far as food is concerned you can't really go wrong a surprisingly good order is the cobb salad which has a ton of meat and flavor,positive
EmBa8UWYRwM_3hagkqwtIg,just to be clear i have not eaten here yet i went here for a benefit for the humane society since it was an event i imagine it was more crowded than usual yet we were still able to be seated immediately the menu looked quite appealing to me and the prices seemed to be on par as wellwhile i was here i ordered several different beers and was really impressed with the selection too the staff were all friendly in the place was clean toothere is a really nice patio and bar outside as well i am definitely going to return here to eat and at the very least try their beer selection again,positive
1T9iKJeQsxgt-0M1RGpVrg,one of the most unique restaurants i have come across  no prices on the menu  at the end of the meal you just tell them how much you want to pay  food was fabulous  we had the shrimp remoulade best we had in no scallop in a lemon sauce crawfish butler  the bread was freshly toasted with a generous amount of butter  everyone was casual there and i think we even had the cooks come out once in a while to bring out the dishes and ask us how we were doingit is very close to the convention center so conveniently located if you are there for business,positive
l_NqE_IHW79Ka-yd6FkQaQ,we are staying at the hotel next door and decided to try gringos because it smelled so good   we were not disappointed  the freshmade guacamole was so so good   it even came with housemade chips  i ordered the carne asada tacos and i highly recommend them  my husband ordered the steak fajita platter and loved it  even our son who ordered sliders and fries thought the food was exceptional   we just moved to tucson and will certainly be returning to gringos,positive
CGVpuQ3FpPWyYFQJQlsjLQ,i expected greatness and i was wrongthis place is perfection we had the opportunity to order anything on the menu and so we shared quite a lot of thingsbetween five of us we covered most of the menu and not one single thing was anything less than amazing i can't stop thinking about what i want to order next time the food is filling but not heavy so the food coma did not happen that could be an issue if you are looking to be stuffed i personally don't care for the style of desserts offered here however if you like churros flan etc you will be delighted   the servers are knowledgeable and attentive the prices are nowhere near offensive the meal you will have for the money you will spend is unmatched downtown has another winner,positive
Ou-_OQUNvBcaAoRU0XPtaQ,i don't care about the food the drinks and dessert are amazing  and yes the steak made me drool,positive
Ps8KgiyJhPqhkjWBklPimg,it's a tight squeeze but it's totally worth it bar gernika is one of the sweet basque eateries in downtown boise they've got rotating taps so you can try different craft beers each time you show up and they have a great menu to complement your beverage bring a friend eat alone just stop in for a quickie you won't regret it,positive

16CRZwuCmHtOhEao62H-jg,my two cents is chickenuevo is great fast food the chicken is super flavorful and the sides are completely respectable as well just as notable is the staff has always been super nice when i drive thru i've only ever ordered straight up chicken with sides of refried beans and red rice so i can't honestly comment on any other menu item but so far so good and we've been pretty regular customers for at least a few years oh their flour tortillas are terrific,positive
KSYONgGtrK0nKXfroB-bwg,ate here twice and had both atmosphere and great tapas the jamon plate bravas spanish omelette stuffed date pork brussels sprouts wine and amazing pear desserti could go on and on if visiting please make a reservation as soon as you arrive in town otherwise you have to eat at 9pm i heard they serve jamon and appetizers in the back bar no reservations but standing only,positive
a39Bc7eixUE1_vOkBjEfwg,pepo's is a gem their food is delicious and changes every day you can always find the traditional cuban favorites you can order cafeteria style or from the menu the ladies who run the place are delightful and will make you feel at home the roast pork tamales picante plantains flan rice pudding and roast chicken were perfect,positive
_EwuYl6cv4td1Mud68U-qg,very good combinations i'm just used to fried versions of empanadas vs these which are baked and more in a pastry dough shell very friendly service though and delicious fillings,positive
S-pwdOmtIPL2UCjQEvKROg,the first time i went it was on a tuesday night and there was only me and what looked to be like a bachelorette party going on i ordered the fried chicken greens macaroni and cheese and added a biscuit in the middle of eating i had to take a picture of my food and text my coworker that i was making embarrassing noises in this restaurant while eating this glorious meal the mac and cheese is funky and unctuous the fried chicken was perfect i normally don't like collard greens but i sucked down these greens like i hadn't seen food in a week the biscuit was just ok came back about two weeks later with the so and he seemed to enjoy the food as well we got fried chicken mac and cheese and cornbread for dessert he got the peanut butter item sorrydon't remember the name and i got the marshmallowgraham crackerthing lol i'm bad with names my guy plowed into both desserts although i liked mine better i'm a fan and will be back,positive
sjH_9PYtfGhzZYsaZmPPzQ,the original columbia restaurant in the ybor city of tampa is a tampa staple this the same restaurant in airside e at tampa international airport heading to atlanta for a business trip great place for lunch or dinner waiting for a flight the menu is limited at this location compared to the ybor city location the menu has some cuban staples including the cuban sandwich and roast pork my lunch today is the roast pork sandwich on cuban bread the meat is tender and juicy the sandwich had mojo juice and onions came with a side of very thinly cut plantains  never had a bad meal at any columbia restaurant this location is always a bit rushed as travelers have to get to their flights if you are stuck at tia have a seat and get a mojito or 2 and enjoy the wait,positive
5fSPNlVUBGMExOy9lgFn0A,the columbia on sand key is our favorite restaurant we love how they prepare the incredible 1905 salad and sangria in front of youentertaining and fresh my boyfriend loves that he can buy and smoke a nice cigar on their deck while we eat great allaround experience,positive
1iuT0GAiXBeIA1BVidxkCw,the meatballs with cheese in a tomato sauce was the best thing we had  all the food was hot fresh and delicious and i loved the variety and quality of what was offered here  the decor is like any sports bar but with the clever twist of having fake slabs of meat hanging from the ceiling and the names of european soccer clubs displayed in memorabilia  fun place nice and helpful wait staff recommended,positive
CGVpuQ3FpPWyYFQJQlsjLQ,killer food tuna app was awesome pulpo to die for wonderful service and very exotic food,positive
T4LfF6fT4_5UuP6ZpMjUGQ,very cute spot id say a great addition to soho cocktails were great especially the red sangria they had a great selection of food and drinks apparently they have a roof top which i can't wait to check out all around we had a great time only downfall out of all the food we ordered tapas style btw nothing was impressive and lacked flavor especially the octopusi will deff be back not to eat but to drink,positive
fyUL2WK1UiPKXDKmutapjQ,stopped in for a bite while getting some bike work done at the pedal shop  i asked for a recommendation and he suggested this pupuseriathe free chips came out with some very tasty salsa which was obviously made fresh on sitethe portions were very large and they had numerous lunch platter specials in the 6 to 8 dollar rangei tried the pork and cheese pupusa and the cheese pupusa when in rome right my first foray into pupusas and they were quite tasty  i would definitely returnplease note that the sign said that they were not serving beerwine at this time so they may be having issues with a liquor license,positive
bY55freuP8C_wr6y5Fid7w,the sandwiches and customer service was phenomenal can't wait to go back i ordered the turkey cuban and they normally don't add salt pepper oil and vinegar  you have to do it yourself the lady at the register stopped what she was doing washed her hand and put on gloves to add for me best place to go for cubans and devil crab,positive
oeD6OiItgca6A66Odak6nA,you really can't beat a guava and creal cheese empanada but 3 come on now but man are they good an occasional guilty pleasure,positive
91tNJxdZJEqWs3qHU2nXPQ,loved the vibe this place has having recently relocated from texas i naturally miss austin and pegs gave me that austin cantina feel we sat outside in the large courtyard  the homebrewed cody ipa was fresh and delicious tons of other beers to chose from including a couple others that are brewed on site they also brew their own sodas no coke or pepsi products here food was good but not the highlight for me however we took advantage of the checkin offer and each had an entree a bit pricey for the portion sizes maybeour server was bright and fantastic i will definitely be back,positive
cXm3EXarmMkvcoEwQgqilg,what a gem visiting mosi and had to find a spot for lunch checked my trustyyelp app and soon we were enjoying a tasty meal i had the venezuelan arepa and my daughter had two empanadas  once chicken and one cheese my arepa was one of the best i've had  flavorful beef along with sweet plantains cheese and black beans with a topping of an ohso yummy white garlic sauce the empanadas were hot and crispy on the outside and although she wouldn't let me taste them she said they were great friendly staff and quite a bargain as well will be a stop next time we are in this area for sure,positive
6CUkqed0rhHtFwQ2i7Otsw,great venue to celebrate a friends birthday we chose to not do the big plates like the paella and did almost all of the tapas instead it was delicious it's great for a group so we can all try a little bit of everything they give you bread refillable for the table which was great because somehow tapas style just never seems filling enough my favorite includes the hanger steak pork belly and patatas bravas it is a wine bar so they have a variety even a malbec that's not on the menu but i also enjoyed their signature cocktails such as the spice rack which is whiskey based with hints of cinnamon and cardamom perfect for this colder weather my only con is the average service on a not so busy friday night we had to remind our waiter about our wine and tapas order several times,positive
3YqUe2FTCQr0pPVK8oCv6Q,i was holding off on writing my 400th review until i could find something worthy of the privilege and yes i probably didn't have to find it 2900 miles away from home but c'est la vie we came here on a recommendation from a friend of mine a clearwater native and she was right on the money while it may not have been the absolute best food i've ever had it has been a while since i enjoyed a dining experience this much my dad and i made reservations for 7 pm on a sunday night and showed up a few minutes early ybor city was kind of deserted but this place was quite full that's always a good sign the restaurant itself makes you feel like you are about to dine in a fairy tale or at the very least on a hollywood set where they are about to shoot a fairy tale movie the building itself takes up the whole block and per my understanding there are over a dozen dining rooms that makes columbia the largest spanish restaurant in the world and by a wide margin one would assume the restaurant has been at this location since 1905 which gave them over a century to accumulate all that treasure and use it to decorate the buildings thronelike chairs vintage pottery and tile mosaic portraying scenes from don quixote  these alone are worth the price of admission i don't even drink but i wanted to order sangria just so that i could admire the clay pitcher it came in i kept looking around and expecting to wake up but it was all oh so true at one point during the evening a couple of photographers entered the room taking pictures of a beautiful young girl in full makeup wearing an exquisite peach dress clearly they were taking pictures for her quinceañera and why not if i were a 15yearold girl of hispanic origin that's where i would want to have my pictures taken our waitress nicole was absolutely phenomenal she made sure that my dad and i had a wonderful experience and she provided some excellent recommendations including one to order less food she was right every time she was beyond professional and courteous she was actually nice and friendly too i'd say that's pretty rare these days now the food i started with caldo gallego a bean soup with ham and chorizo it was rich and filling as it's supposed to be i am glad i only ordered a cup because i could definitely see it being a whole meal for someone not me of course then i had the 1905 salad which was prepared for us tableside don't let the word salad fool you it still had plenty of ham and cheese in it did i mention their bread it was freshly baked hot and delicious after the first two courses full of ham sausage cheese with bread on the side it was time for the entree i had the paella campesina with beef pork chicken chorizo and beans the meat was cooked spanish style ie cooked really well done it's expected in a traditional paella and i knew that going in but it's still a little weird to me still the paella was outstanding it wasn't just some meat over rice it had a distinct flavor and a good mix of spices as you might imagine we were really full by the end of the meal unfortunately someone ordered something flambe for dessert and i was immediately drawn to it like moth to a flame we had to order something the flambeed delicacy was the brazo gitano spongecake with cream and strawberries and i would have ordered it had it not been for the four magic words on the menu white chocolate bread pudding we wanted to order both but nicole wisely talked us out of it the white chocolate bread pudding was incredible sadly we were so stuffed that we left 13 of it on the plate i almost felt bad for not finishing it but i literally could not eat another bite as i struggled to walk 80 feet to my rental car i kept thinking how much a four course meal for two with a glass of wine a bottle of water an iced tea and a cup of coffee would cost at a similar restaurant in san francisco or new york here in tampa it was about 100  tip and it was an amazing value i honestly cannot wait to go back,positive
PQYuPr2Dfm2S49EULjl1qw,great food hot fresh rolls with butter arrived first yummy we ordered grilled tilapia with yuca frites and plantains sweet and grilled chicken with rice and beans all delicious plantains were out of this world service was good but not too friendly hence 4 stars,positive
bY55freuP8C_wr6y5Fid7w,no trip to tampa is complete without a cuban sandwich during my brother's visit to tampa he mentioned he wanted a cuban sandwich so i immediately decided to take him to west tampa sandwich shop you can't beat the prices at this nofrills tiny cuban restaurant located on north armenia avenue for less than 20 our table ordered three cans of soda two cuban sandwiches and the ropa vieja with yellow rice and plantains so cheap and the portions are hugeso why not 5 stars while the cuban sandwich is delicious and priced at a bargain price of 325 i personally felt that there was not enough mojo pork on the sandwich in comparison to other cuban sandwiches in tampa i'd be willing to pay an extra dollar or two for more porkdefinitely recommend this tampa staple but if you order the cuban sandwich pay for extra pork,positive
3YqUe2FTCQr0pPVK8oCv6Q,wow  looking for excellent cuban food  good service great food cool decor  i'll definitely be back every time i'm in tampa  what more is there to say,positive

8fN1DiPUUWAhLsZW4xSSJQ,only issue with this is that it's a little messy to eat but who cares  the food was delicious i had the pabellon arepa which was stuffed with shredded beef cheese beans and sweet plantains  so many great flavors in this despite looking so simple  i was really happy with the portion size didn't feel like i sometimes do with trucks like these where i could eat 3 more  ratios of ingredients were really good too  i'm just glad i finally got a chance to try them out while they were in love park and get there before the big crowds started,positive
x2ly0NsSTMmMpljpdIZdYA,this place is amazing good ambiance excellent service and incredible food we tried several of their appetizers and they were all incredible so it is impossible to say which one was the best as for the deserts my personal favorite was the lemon tart but the crema catalana was also to die for cadiz is not your typical restaurant this place goes above and beyond,positive
HvBLY3-R1KxocZapeAAvZQ,we have been to other locations all excellent  we had expressed this to the waiter and the experience was amazing from top of the line service top notch food even management stopped by to talk and made sure everything was above and beyond thank you for making my 60th  birthday faboulous waiter suggested a beautiful wine we ended up with two bottles because we ordered a lot of food we started with jamon mancheboand druken goat cheese moved on to potato bravas chorizo in fig wine sauce octopus salad and a few other surprises from the house i love barcelona and was thrilled to find one in nashville,positive

dT19ZJyw9o5VUr6MhoA07Q,went to isabella for valentines day dinner and was pleasantly surprised  utilized open table to make the reservation and was pleased that when we arrived there was only a brief wait  the menu had a set selection and was a bit on the pricey side at 40person however the amount and quality of food that was presented made the entire night worth it  the element that set the night aside as a success however was the service  even with a packed house our waitress was helpful enjoyable to talk to and most importantly attentive while being overwhelmed with tables  i look forward to coming here again on a day to try their nighly menu which looks very promising,positive
EmBa8UWYRwM_3hagkqwtIg,what an amazing place the food was amazing you can tell the chef loves his job and thank you to our waiter who was amazing  pretty sure his name was tony i have never had better service before i will definitely be back ,positive
KSYONgGtrK0nKXfroB-bwg,atmosphere service and food all receive an a in my books met a friend there for brunch and was not disappointed in the slightest the menu was simple with fresh ingredients and a hint of decadence which created a magnitude of complimentary flavors we shared the spanish french toast which was probably one of the best french toasts i have ever tasted the croissant as well as one of the benedict's not my favorite but still good being that we are in the midst of a heat spell in the beginning of spring this menu adjusted to the warming up of temperatures perfectly the gazpacho bloody mary was light and flavorful yet added depth with a stick of proscuitto the filtered spring water was refilled consistently from the waitstaff the plates were cleared in a reasonable fashion and the recommendations were on point not to mention the decor light airy trendy in the sense that it has elements we will all flash back to in ten years and say that was sooo 2017 yet classic in the sense of being santa barbara timeless i have to mention the pursehooks in the restroom placed in the perfect location it's as if a woman went in to the restroom and said no here this is where the hook should be but rarely is and that's me being particularly bothered by so many other restaurants who fail to cater to applicability and reason the best part about loquita is that i can see myself there with a multitude of people my inlaws who travel the world and have simpler exceptional taste but don't like the music too loud or the seats too crowded my girlfriends who also have exceptional taste but like to get a little tipsy and celebratory when the occasions arise my husband who has exceptional taste but is a stickler for excellent service and tasty food as well as businessnetworkingbrainstorming meetings all in all i would highly recommend this place and will be returning shortly,positive
sjH_9PYtfGhzZYsaZmPPzQ,terrible restaurant the pork sandwich i order was so gross i quit eating it after two bites i ate here a year ago in tampa airport and told myself never again yet for some dumb reason decided to give it a second try go to pot belly down the terminal,negative
CGVpuQ3FpPWyYFQJQlsjLQ,visited last night with a friend for happy hour  drinks and food were great service was not sat at the bar and had to flag the bartender down for everything we wanted she greeted us but never came back to get our order  never made eye contact with us once we were able to get her to take our order she was sulky when our food was delivered she never came to check on it until we asked her a question about one of the items had to flag her down to get another round of margaritas  had to get her attention to get water toward the end of our visit a young man was making drinks and we asked him what one was he told us and offered us a sample he was a much better bartender in 90 seconds than the young lady was all night we are women of a certain age we felt completely ignored  we are also generous  we were not last night,negative
9uRj85PviKNiMCYPwiJyIw,i've been here three times and my experience has always been mediocre in general the food is authentic cuban fare and it's pretty decent honestly not the best i've ever had but i can't complain much either maybe a little on the greasy side but tasty  the staff is not super friendly but they aren't rude by any means either lacking in smiles but seem focused on providing good service which is goodcame today and they were out of mojitos the main reason we came their sangria is okay so decided to stay they had one server covering a section of 8 tables and 3 of them were put together to accommodate a party of 11 that had just arrived  poor thing had the whole party to herself plus a bunch of other tables wasn't her fault she was running her butt off in the hot sun as a former server they should never stuck her in a section larger than 5 tables she did her best but we waited a looong time for everything and i could see other tables getting upset too one table ran out of drinkswater for a solid 20 minutes and they were getting antsy to just pay and leavein my humble opinion this place does well enough because of their location and the cuban foodcultural aspect  seems to draw enough in tourists and local noncuban folk who admire the history of our beloved cuban tampanians  the problems i've seen every time i'm here reflect poor management with the right direction this place has excellent potential,negative
GVN0YpoDXBU0OpxlCi_3Ng,we waited for over an hour to receive our orderwhich was cold nope sorry not paying top dollar for poor ambience and cold food since when is the local baseball team allowed to order beer buckets and turn a once quality restaurant into a bar scene well through the dinner service we called ahead to reserve a table at 7 the food made it around 810 when we last visited there were roses adorning each place setting and the food was amazing this was supposed to be our date night we dressed for the occasion and came with expectations of quality food good service and proper ambience low standard service for high dollar prices i have never been so disappointed in a restaurant,negative
9uRj85PviKNiMCYPwiJyIw,we went on a saturday for lunch it is very popular and busy on weekends we put our names at 1220 pm they seated us after 20 minutes server came to us around10 minutes later food was served at 200 pm all this wait can be forgiven if the food meets the expectations fish sandwich was cold and they bring the wrong soup my husband patiently waited for right soup our expectations were tall for a fancy cuban lunch and this completely fell short,negative
l_NqE_IHW79Ka-yd6FkQaQ,i was at gringo twice this past week for happy hour with friends and found that this is not a place i would recommend  the staff seemed confused about happy hour prices and we sat in the wrong spot on the patio to even qualify for happy hour prices  too many rules  service needs much improvement  we waited a very long time to order and once we did our food was delivered to the wrong table  our waitress ended her shift in the middle of our visit and i guess that means that we get no service  i will not return  management needs to take a long hard look at what is happening as this will destroy the business,negative
kxOR-Z62MnMUlCZWQmd2iQ,i've been coming to this restaurant for years  it used to be one of my favorite places to bring out of town guests  they've changed the menu a couple times over the years eliminating my favorite dishes but i was able to find some replacement dishes  but the last time i went they had completely butchered the menu down to nothing  they got rid of all the dishes with the quality ingredients and kept the cheapest things to make  i won't be back until i see another menu update,negative
kjthGegrE7mdEny-q-uMgg,i was a little late making reservations for mother's day brunch and table 11 was the only restaurant still taking reservations for a party of threenow i know why the food was phenomenal but the front of the house was severely understaffed so service was terrible we had to ask for coffee and water three times before we got it we ordered eggs and pancakes and after ten minutes of trying to wave someone down we had to get up to find someone to ask for ketchup butter and syrup every table had to get up at least once to track down a waitress for something menus silverware drinks the check i'm writing this as we wait for the check which we requested for the first time about ten minutes ago it looks like even the kitchen staff is getting frustrated with the poor service as a chef is now bringing out the food and yelling at the two waitresses to pick up the pace i'm hoping this was just a bad day so i'll give it one more chance since the food was so yummy,negative
tyxDsvtQkTDDy-e-psidEA,honestly  i didn't like the food and i been in other puerto rican food places  all the mofongo were uncooked the carne frita was salty   really not a to go place for me,negative
uZsStnH9w2xY15og9VsQZA,i will never step foot in this dump again  me and my friend went in and was told it would be 15min to get a table   two not one but two white couples walked in after us and was seated before us   if you are black or brown save your time  money,negative
FdJliLMmxccEswA_ULO06w,not that great beans were microwaved the bowl was piping hot and beans ice cold  cuban was nothing special ended up taking half home for the dog  not sure the waitress was that happy to have any customers was wearing an outfit like she was heading off the gym or beach and did not seem to care,negative
pARcoIwXlijaXVCfp5jdsQ,looking for a fantastic cuban experience in tampa decided to visit this new place service was great although she seem a little lost understandable they are working on their kinks no biggie owner was very attentive food ordered the yuca and mojo witn chicken and vegetables chicken tasted like from publix yuca and rice had no flavor and my vegetables were uneatable bean soup was ok my friend ordered a sandwich and she hardly ate it i also left the mayority of my food i understand they are new but the chef needs to get it together for now i am not interested on coming back anytime soon unless they get a real cuban chef or a chef that knows what he is doing still searching for that great cuban experience when in town but sadly not this one,negative
uaKXyCNVXWdfOOdbM88pMA,horribullshtthat was the worst fake cuban iver ever had it was a cold ham sandwich with an inch of pork with lettuce n tomatoes n mayo that aint no damn cuban the beans were whackthat devil thing was mostly imitation crab meatwhacklisten we go out to eat alot and u xan tell when theres passion n love in food and when its just a way to sellthere is no passion in that food no authenticity nada i want my money back even my kids said ma this is not a cuban really,negative
HvBLY3-R1KxocZapeAAvZQ,i was looking forward to enjoying a evening outside at barcelona unfortunately it was a horrendous experience i have been up for hours in incredible pain and showing classic signs of food poisoning i have a fever unbelievable cramping and nausea i will also add that we ask to sit at a lovely table and was told it was being held for a larger party that was arriving soon they had told me on the phone reservations were not allowed we are in a corner under a speaker the party that arrived had four people in it the same as ours,negative
1iuT0GAiXBeIA1BVidxkCw,what a disappointment  when this st louis spinoff first started up in indy it showed some real promise  but now after several years serving the same corner in downtown indianapolis it has skunk into mediocrity and that just the food  poor inattentive although friendly service and watered down drinks makes it the perfect place for only high school graduation parties  is this place in survival mode or do the owners don't care any more   if it's the former than the only way for this place to make it is to get back to the basics  good food  great service  if it the latter go back to st louis and reopen a fast food restaurant in its location  at least the food would be cheaper,negative
f5D33_M0RWudFR7Q-fPlJw,owner treated employee like he was trash within customer view and hearing many things on the menu not available and what was was substandard was first and last time i will ever visit,negative
kxOR-Z62MnMUlCZWQmd2iQ,from the hostess to the bartenders to the servers all around badfirst they skipped us in rotation for tables and when we asked about it they acted weird and then scrambled to find us a seat but weren't apologetic or even remotely accommodating about it when i asked for a specific alcohol the bartender quipped she didn't have that and when i pointed out that i was looking at the bottle she got huffy then the server after we finally got sat left us sitting for about fifteen minutes and hastily remarked that she didn't 'notice' us there don't expect to do courses here even if you order them in a specific way it comes out willynilly they even brought me someone else's food and i started eating it it was very similar to my dish and do you know they came and took the entree away from me and served it straight to someone else the plate i was already eating just sat a partially consumed dish in front of another customerseriously,negative
6l98B73FdO1ebgz9fe6pvQ,what a mess this place is not tapas it is family style portions being served not small plates the irony is that they include the definition of tapas in the center of the menu they only compliment i can give the food is that it photographs wellthe charcuterie plate was so sad the cuts were basic garden variety sausages that you don't even have to get from the deli counter they paired this with a strawberry glaze unripe slices of peach to the point that they were crisp  sour and sweet almond biscotti that was stale these would be accouterments with a cheese plate in fact they were the same ones included with the baked brie the baked brie dish was the only one that i would consider good but it should be a dessert dish it seemed like a majority of the food was from frozen the fries for the poutine 100 were crinkle cut freezer section fries i fairly confident the gravy on it was from a jar it was super salty the same goes for the beef sort ribs meat that was with the poutine salty  confident it was presliced from a package the artichoke hearts stuffed with sausage were close to inedible sour from a can hearts stuffed with unseasoned sausage the beef empanadas were disgusting first off they were in the same puff pasty used for the baked brie this is the incorrect kind of dough to be used and they should be fried especially if you have them under the fried section of your menu the filling was bland ground beef and offputting the garlic mayo that was with it as a dipping sauce was disgusting as well i love garlic i like mayo i regularly combine the two to make spreads but this was gross the calamari were a mess the ones on the top of the plate were overcooked and bland the ones on the bottom of the plate were overcooked  soggy from being soaked in the pico de gallo juices for the price point of the dishes this place is not even close to worth itthen we have the service also a mess there is one waiter who is talented and did his job well sadly he was not serving our table our waitress took forever to come to our table forgot to tell us the specials we had to ask her when she came back and had to harass her to take away plates from the small crowded table the other girl was around middle or high school age and was tasked with bussing the tables both her  our waitress walked past out tabled more than 6 times with out clearing anything when we got the younger girl to clear she took our plates we were eating from but did not replace them we had to ask her to bring us since this our other dishes has just come out same went with refilling the water she  our waitress would pass the table several times carrying pitches but not refill anything based on this whole mess we decided to skip the dessert offerings pay  leave i am baffled by how this place was packed and all the positive reviews are the standards that low in the area does no one know what tapas is supposed to be i'm just at a loss for explanation but will not bother traveling back,negative
3nYIq4THGUOgQCAF-mkd7w,sat for 20 minutes at a table outside and  didn't even get our drink order taken they were not even packed only 6 people seated  tries to get waiters attention and he completely ignored me pure incompetence  don't waster your time too many good places to eat in the area,negative
7Kv5lFl-skksZlzTqJpnmw,went in at 1245 no chicken was prepared at a cuban restaurant  took them a while to even wait on us  the guy talked to my husband the whole time and ignored me  guess women are inferior to him  it's bad there i will not go back,negative
T4LfF6fT4_5UuP6ZpMjUGQ,the only good thing was the magnificent view upstairs and the staff at the upstairs bar they made us a good spanish old fashioned drink the computer went down and we had to pay cash also computer down meant no food and drink upstairs after that we went to hostess at 6pm and were told there was a 3 hour wait for dinner even though 10 to 15 tables were vacant we put our name in anyway and had a drink upstairs after the computer went down upstairs we decided to go down and check the table situationstill 10 to 15 tables open at 7pm hostess made no attempt to reassure seems like a recipe for failure when people are ready to eat and tables are available for a whole hour but can't be seated due to reservations we left and ate at haven down the street we were seated immediately even though business was brisk we had a wonderful meal there my thoughts about bulla is that it is being mismanaged computers don't make food or drinks people make food and drinks how did we conduct business before computers there is absolutely no reason to cut people off so what if your inventory is off for a shift also empty tables for a whole hour your losing money and pissing people off won't be back for long while,negative
5fSPNlVUBGMExOy9lgFn0A,ok here is my review the mojito which is the restaurant's signature drink was basically lime and club soda  second visit to give it another try same thoughtsthe waitress was loud and she took our order stating well  the bartender is another area i can make them better but did not offer to comp us for the first round  the food is so overpriced and honestly rather go to a latin whole in the wall place for cheaper price,negative
kxOR-Z62MnMUlCZWQmd2iQ,stopped by for a drink and dessert after my friend and i had dinner elsewhere hostess was absolutely rude  i was so disappointed  first person you get greeted by at the restaurant is a hostess  they should be kind and friendly you think  not here unprofessional servicei don't even want to explain what and how rude she was  my friend said damn she is so rude loud enough that other hostess could hear we sat at the bar had few drinks and a dessert  i noticed the bartender wasn't even wearing gloves when she was grabbing chopped fruits to put in a glass of sangria  we looked at each other and said  no sangria for us lol,negative
S8ZFYEgMejpChID8tzKo9A,i am torn here between 2 and 3 stars  i'm going with 2 just because of the price  for the price i was expecting more  there are no bad dishes but to many average dishes  the one standout was the pernil asada roasted pig  after having this i would like to return and try the roasted suckling pig,negative
02jAPgIHC9LPqOEtdS57SQ,where do i begin let me be clear i absolutely love the fact that this restaurant caters to vegans in fact it is the only reason my friends and i visited in the first place unfortunately the service was bad enough to keep us from ever returning  i was in a group of four on a busy saturday afternoon with one server the owner was present but no one else was working the floor understandably everything took a very long time because of the serverguest ratio what isn't excusable is how incredibly rude the server was i have worked in the service industry multiple times so i always give servers the benefit of the doubt but this was a truly bad experience what is clear is that she cannot handle that many tables alone she takes out her frustration on guests and she has not read the vegan menu i'm going to assume she doesn't know the menu because the alternative is that she lies to her guests needless to say we are never ever going back,negative
uZsStnH9w2xY15og9VsQZA,i just don't get this restaurant is it italian cuban mexican  came in for some carb loading the night before our half marathon and this was the only place that would seat us within 30 minutes  we were hungry and short on time so we went for it despite my inner yelp voice screaming at me to reconsider due to the very mixed 35 stars  long story short i should've listened  i waited weeks until writing this review so i don't sound like i'm ranting so here goesit wasn't crowded even for a saturday night  there seems to be a lot of servers who do a lot of walking around but nobody is talking to guests or bussing tables or carrying food  we flagged at least 3 different people and finally managed to get someone after over 30 minutes of being seated  the waitress who finally took our order seemed friendly and took our order and had it memorized  bad mistake  ended up getting our orders wrong  my brother ordered the chicken marsala and got eggplant parm  my brother in law ordered an appetizer that never came  and his overpriced order of lasagna looked so sad and small  when the marsala finally came out it was one pathetic looking chicken breast i was fortunate enough that my order was fine  my chicken parm was cooked fine but my side of angel hair and marinara tasted like it was from a jar  however even if all our food came out on time the sub mediocre quality and taste of food does not justify the price  the waitress nonchalant attitude didn't help either  nor did her responses that made us feel that this was somehow our faultmaybe we shouldn't have ordered italian food  maybe it's better as lunch  i read good stuff about their cubans and black beans and rice  or maybe this place should just stick with their margaritas and bar fare this place was definitely not a good pick for us and we will definitely not be headed back2017 yelp 100 challenge 15100,negative
S-pwdOmtIPL2UCjQEvKROg,the food was ok which we would have let slide if it wasn't for the terrible service and the shocker of a bill it didn't even cross my mind that they would charge 28 for 8 oz of over cooked flank steak if i'm going to spend 100 on dinner for two i can think of many restaurants that are more deserving of my money,negative
4xEJiEQERBvr2jAZQSeF2g,it's really a 2 12 star review but i'm still a little bitterso the beautiful wife and i stopped by mojo tonight  we were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated at a table that felt a little hidden  but hey there was another table in the section occupied plus the hostess really seemed to put a lot of thought into where to seat us  when we walked in i did notice group of staff standing around the bar talking  strangely i thought this was going to be a good thing  lots of people to promptly bring us food and lots of drinks rightwrongso after being seated and given menus we had enough time to memorize the menu  i'm sure i'm just being a dick because it was like 10 minutes but it wasn't that busy and the conglomeration of staff at the bar was fresh in my mindfinally our assigned server stopped by expressing surprise that we were there  apparentlyallegedly the hostess failed to tell him that he had a table  at least when he asked how long we had been waiting i told him long enough that we were a minute away from leavingso that unpleasantness aside we started off with drinks  i was glad to see that a decent selection of beers on tap i went with anchor steam  the wine list looked decent but my menu only had half the list it had the same page twice  they do carry green truck organic wines and are reasonably priced though it's not called green truck anymore but i digressanyway we had and i can't copy and paste from their online menu so if you want more details go look at their websitetuna  it's fine but nothing special  if anything the tuna was overshadowed by lots of salad and breadbacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese with the balsamic reduction  these were pretty good but not mind blowinggarlic chile shrimp and sexy grits  the consensus was this is scampi over grits  and i have no idea why they're sexy unless the big chunks of tomato and garlic was part of the sexiness  or was that part of the shrimp  i don't know   our server did bring out some bread to sop up the sauce which was nice  and the bread was hot so there's a pluschicken kabob jerk chicken with key lime yogurt drizzle  with cafe natasha so close i wish we hadn't gotten this  it was ok but the sauce was way too sweetit might sound like a lot of food but the portions are fairly smalllike any good bell curve the end of the meal involved us waiting for a bit to get the check  oh wellwhen we left i couldn't help but notice that there were three servers chatting with the hostess  it's just weird  i think they need to utilize their staff better  or somethingi don't think we'll be going back  there's nothing really too exciting going on here,negative
8fN1DiPUUWAhLsZW4xSSJQ,i remember when delicias had a couple of asianlooking venezuelan ladies running the truck and they churned out delicious albeit slightly pricey for its time arepas for 6 each with your choice of shredded beef with cheese chicken and guacamole bean and cheese and chorizo then a new owner took over the truck and kept the quality more or less the same for 1 more now there appears to be a new owner with a menu with no prices my chorizo plaintain guac arepa was 8 which seems to be what the price of any arepa on the menu is according to other reviews 8 is considered highend for a food truck when you have the guts to charge 8 for a sandwich it better be hella good because i can spend 8 somewhere else and get hella good stuff unfortunately my arepa was just okay maybe i've been spoiled by the arepas the previous two owners made maybe i've been spoiled by my recent visit to sazon this arepa just isn't worth 8 i could count maybe three little pieces of chorizo in my sandwich three big chunks of plantain and lots of guac the good stuff was sitting on top the black beans all the way on the bottom sadly once you finish all the good stuff the black beans were kind of bland and even blah i think the biggest problem is the arepa itself it's big and doughy as if it were not cooked all the way through i think i know why they made it so thick to hold all the ingredients so it won't fall apart but that's what the aluminum foil is for this truck does get points for using lots of cheese an ungodly amount the plantains were also very good the chorizo was very mild not the spicy chorizo i'm used to overall a bland sandwich that is too pricey for what it is,negative
1iuT0GAiXBeIA1BVidxkCw,the food is always fairly good the baked goat cheese is my favorite appetizer as it never disappoints but the service is almost always terrible i've been at least 68 times and only has good service once the sangria pitchers were just terrible basically pitchers of water ice a few cubes of fruit i don't even know if they put wine in it in the past the sangria was good but not anymore the waitress served some of our food to the wrong table and instead of apologizing the said it happens just wow,negative
lKlo4YWw1zrtbcxn3XA65w,took them 45 minutes to seat us for our reservation then when we asked the waitress what was good on the menu she rattled off her favorites a handful of which we proceeded to order only to find out that they were out of 4 of them including guacamole  also as far as tapas goes only about half of the products are tapas  the rabbit the sea bass  not really sharing foods the taste was good but doesn't warrant a return trip,negative

USOHCmTPr0CU6UGp6YCYuw,beware that they use extra small togo containers so the portions you get are much smaller than average i took a regular sized container there and they said they would have to charge me more to use that one i refuse to be overcharged for under portions of foodi will not go back also they are expensive for a food court joint be ready to spend about 10 bucks or more for an under portion meal with drink and still be hungry after your done eating,negative
3YqUe2FTCQr0pPVK8oCv6Q,i understand it's christmas day and the restaurant is busy but my family and myself arrived for our reservation at 1815 were sat at 1830 promptly our waiter sergio acknowledged our presence and within 5 minutes took our beverage order of 2 mojitos and a 1905 martini returned with fresh hot bread 5 minutes shortly after and took ours food order every time he would pass by we'd be greeted with a let me check on your drinks and your food 1930 rolls around and our dinner arrives with no drinks scott delivers our food and is set to prepare our salads table side as tradition dictates unfortunately the salad was already prepared and just placed in front of us at the same time dinner the two orders of la complete cubana were delicious my order of lechon asado the evenings special for christmas as i went to take a bite it was frozen i went for the maduros and they were just as cold and to the equivalence as compared to a rock and the rice was cold i waived down a manager asked him to please take my plate and have it removed from our bill tradition would dictate that the manager on duty would stop by and ask how things can be fixed no appearance by the manager sergio returns that the meal will be completely taken care of by him such a sad day for columbia we've experienced better service and quality in st augustine  san armand's circle,negative
QqvMMaeNJqaEJihkhdYiAQ,our last lunch at guido's was really frustrating  we were crammed into the dining room so tightly that the wait staff had a challenge trying to simply deliver food to the tables  our table was inches from tables to our left and right and we had a challenge trying to leave because the party  of six were seated so closely behind us   obtaining reservations at guido's was frustrating at best  we tried to make an online reservation today for four tuesday night but were told by guido's website that they could not accept four people and then prompted us to call the restaurant  we called and were told that guido's is typically not very busy tuesday nights and they had strict rules against taking reservations on the phone  we wanted to bring two new friends to experience guido's for their first time but after we shared the the obstacles we experienced this evening we are removing guido's from our restaurant list as there are plenty of exceptional restaurants on the hill  we called charlie gitto's and got in immediately easy  good food friendly wait staff highdensity dining room seating noisy almost zero intimacy,negative
KSYONgGtrK0nKXfroB-bwg,just went to the fiesta party at loquita worst event ever total rip off food was not good simple lunch i could have made at home and just handed out some fruit for dessert it is quite upsetting i do like loquita for dinner even though it is overpriced but this was such a disappointment with outrageous pricing  for the amount paid food and drinks should have been unlimited it has tarnished my view of this place,negative
-nFhHFySIOCBQW4-zHtnHw,i've been here many times for the vaca frita and it's been amazing with lots of flavor i think the chef changed because the vaca frita wasnt even fried it had zero flavor i was so disappointed everything we got today was without enough flavor we wont be going again and i am sad about that because we have been loyal customers for 5 years,negative
Ou-_OQUNvBcaAoRU0XPtaQ,was it that i dined too late the boyfriend and i decided to go to jamonera to discuss a possible trip to spain around 9pm tonighti dined here 8 months ago and enjoyed myself but this time not so much nothing here tasted freshly prepared the papas fritas lacked the heat that one would expect from a potato coming directly from the frier the hanger steak looked succulent but was chewy and lukewarm the rice for our seafood paella was burnt at the bottom but oddly the rice was cold also for 25 bucks i expected more than 2 shrimp the sangria was forgetful and the bread pudding was lukewarm and shockingly awful compared to the piping hot bread pudding that is served at their sister restaurant barbuzzo which is nearby the grilled side of bread which is also served piping hot and fresh at barbuzzo was lukewarm and hideous at jamonera how can there be such a difference in quality between this place and barbuzzo which is right across the streetthe bf and i are thinking about planning a trip to italy now,negative

I5KZm-NnxYeEQsmp6nK5_w,i'll give this spot another chance but the burritos i got from here were barely wrapped super loose rectangle instead of tube and dripped so much juice that it formed a puddle in my takeout box had to eat it with a fork and knife because i couldn't really pick it up,negative
6_QyUZW5QNsLlYJXjgmfAg,this used to be a favorite of ours  eating outside with the pam trees and waterfall was fantastic waterfall gone  we opted to eat inside this time as it was very hot but the ac was barely workingour waiter said it breaks once a week really then replace itwho wants to pay a lot to eat and sweat   the menu has been changed many of items gone the first three things we asked about were gone along w the olive garnish on emits plates  then our waiter came over and cleared our table after three of us shared a veal meatblall tapas and a cod tapastwo items  while clearing he said dessert anyone  when we said we were still waiting for the vegetable item he looked surprised and said didnt u eat that already  we would know if we ate ithe came back and said i yelled at the chef for you he forgot to make it  since he had to ask which veg item we ordered pretty sure he never put it in  so we sat and sweated and waited  we had that dish in the past it had been big chunks of veggies now it is little shredded pieces    so disappointing   no longer on our favorite list  and we were not comped or even apologized for the mess up,negative
zSDqW5cZq9Bg7O9vMpJ6Tg,wow i can't understand the positive reviews my experience sucked big time nobody available to seat us until my extremely old mother in law wandered toward the kitchen to let them know that they had their first customers for a friday lunch and it was past noon that should have been a flag then the waitercook joked in spanish with my guests and they all had a great time using me as the butt of jokes saying such that i can pay but not eat there haha that's a good one will my food be safe to eat cuz it sure the fuck tasted nasty i had two bites and let my inlaw pay jokes on them,negative
5X43mcuo8-oq9NUZi5m7Jg,decor and ambiance did not match the name this is a local bar trying to be different and failing badly  american 70's hit music in a cuban bistro really table cloth had stains no cuban beers on menu only cuban mixed drink is the mojitothe menu was no different that what i would expect from chipotle  i ordered the burger  ordered my burger medium got a piece of charcoals  i couldn't finish itmy daughter ordered a cuban sandwich she left half on the plate,negative
PN5XfZbqf1SI1mZBYSJzVA,i had dined at vizcaya previously and enjoyed it sure it wasn't the most attentive in service but i'm pretty laid back and the food was yummy however when i make a reservation and drive all the way across town on a weekend night only to find that no table is ready and won't be ready for a long time i was extremely frustrated the host seemed put off when i asked him to give me an estimate of time and didn't even apologize when he walked the restaurant and told me it wouldn't be for awhile i was friendly throughout this whole process so it wasn't as though he was reciprocating poor behavioras seinfeld once noted to a car rental company they know how to take the reservation but they don't know how to hold the reservation and the holding is the most important part very disappointing,negative
F3bzaJzhvsWPD3JQYSqrwQ,i love la teresita in tampa this place however a pure shame this is my second time attempting to give it a shot we walked in to an empty restaurant and waited to be seated at the counter no one was there so we waited and waited and waitedpeace out,negative
QqvMMaeNJqaEJihkhdYiAQ,i had been told for some time that i needed to check out st louisstyle pizza and guido's was pretty close to our hotel so we ventured here for dinner on our vacation st louis pizza is distinguished as a round pizza that is generally cut into squares a personal petpeeve of mine with a crackerthin crust and proval cheese which is a blend of provolone swiss and white cheddar cheeseswe were greeted and seated immediately and our server was friendly but i think we were his last table as he was cut because we were really rushed we had toasted ravioli to start another st louis staple and this wasn't impressive but it served the purpose of staving off our hunger we ordered a guido's deluxe for dinner now as i stated round pizza cut into squares is truly irritating to me however i won't fault the place for doing it i will fault them for not cutting it through jess tried to pry her first piece off and ended up wearing it when the waiter came ot check and found me sawing away on the pie with a butter knife he tried to correct me on the fact that it was squares i had to point out that it really wasn't cut at all he took it back to the kitchen and had it recut but it was done in a very sloppy fashion the cheese mixture was not particularly good it was extremely gooey creamy and ended up dripping off the pieces and the blend is a very strange taste to me they offer a choice of provel v mozzarella when you order the server was very eager for us to leave so he couldoverall i wasn't a fan of the experience and this style of pizza in general is not one that i'll try again,negative
ezB8e2rijjViprrcTdIiQQ,maybe if i wasn't from miami and used to places like la carreta and sergio's this place would seem ok the standards need to be brought up considerably here a restoration on the interiors would serve this place immensely as well as closer attention to perfecting the coffee,negative
hKvPFno02JUW-sGCkHSnMQ,hah wait how are people actually giving this place more than 1 star this place has horrible food i was embarrassed that i invited friends out for dinner and suggested this place food was all cooked completely wrong everything tasted horrible i also have been to spain 6 times nothing nothing is authentic about this food they also seemed to be out of everything we wanted to order on a saturday night and we were the only ones there the server was also going front every few minutes and smoking cigarettes and doing some shady business it was honestly the worst dining experience i've ever had in my 13 years living in center city this place will close down in a few months not sure why i'm even writing this,negative
6_QyUZW5QNsLlYJXjgmfAg,i was really excited about this place and had such high expectations because of the high rating  i was really not impressed and in fact disappointed  after living in miami for 9 years where there are so many ceviche restaurants i have to say that this place had the worst ceviche i've ever had  we had the ceviche de salmon which i could only have a few bites of because the lime was extremely bitter  we also ordered the gambas al ajillo which is a sauteed shrimp in a garlic sauce  we ordered the full portion size  it was just shrimp sitting in garlic sauce that's it nothing else  i understand these are tapas but still shrimp sitting in garlic sauce with nothing else it really was not worth the 18 that it cost the best thing we had was the deviled eggs  needless to say we won't be back,negative
5X43mcuo8-oq9NUZi5m7Jg,i was in the mood for a cuba sandwich and happened to be in new hope so thought why not overall it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great eitherwe ordered the guacamole for an appetizer a bowl of black bean soup it was a very cold day for me a cup of tortilla soup for my friend and we both had the cuban sandwiches the guacamole wasn't bad just didn't have much taste more concerning was the acidic taste it left in your mouth not the kind from lime juice but the kind when food is starting to go bad it wasn't a mealkiller but it didn't leave us wanting to finish the whole portion by any means the tortilla chips served with the dish were super greasy again not a complete miss but it didn't want you yearning to reach back into the plate for morethe soups were sadly a let down too my black bean which should be a standout at any cuban restaurant was just soso it wasn't very hot and coupled with the dollop of sour cream just cooled it to barely warm of course it was a real cold day and hot soup would have hit the spot but after the guacamole we weren't expecting a great meal anyway again there's just no flavor in either soup my friend liked his a little better but there's just no seasoning in either dish the sandwiches were okay and i mean just okay the bread wasn't authentic cuban bread and although the rest was pretty typical we had to ask for pickles because mine had none and my friends had one small pickle slice for the whole sandwich my friend opted for the french fries which he described as okay and i had the side salad which you should not request which had that same acidic taste in the dressing that made me immediately stop eating for fear of the unknown the salad dressing was definitely past it's sell by date i believe it was a homemade dressing but not sure when that batch was made maybe a daily test of the food that's been kept awhile isn't a bed idea heremy friend was on his last 12 of sandwich and the waitress said do you want your check now which really confused us i asked him to look at the front door to see if there was line or something but that was not the case including us there were three other tables occupied in the whole place which should have told volumes at lunchtime on a sunny saturdaylastly it occurred to me after we left that the fruit flies they're pretty big here we saw hovering around the tables were most likely being fed on rotten fruitfood in the restaurant it would explain the acid offtaste of a few items and thought if the food were fresher would the flies go away i'm not accusing them of unsanitary conditions but i can't think of another restaurant i've been to that had fruit flies hovering around i've only encountered them around rotten food and i do have my suspicions about two parts of our meal there are so many great places to eat in new hope and this one just doesn't seem to be one of them although the name suggests latin flavors aside from the music you'll find little else here,negative
T4LfF6fT4_5UuP6ZpMjUGQ,drinks and food was great however the service was horrible our waitress janisa was the rudest server we ever had we sat at the roof top bar and sat a table of 12 people with an attitude she told us if we sit she is our server and not to order from the bar it was a busy night and service was slow the husbands went to the bar for drinks while the rest of us staying eating at the table when it was time to pay janisa proceeded to throw the mini clip board with the stack of bills on the table  nothing said 4 of the 7 bills were paid right away the last 3 bills were still open as those were at the bar or walking around the waitress came back by with a second copy of the bill and threw it infront of us and said these are still open which was obvious to all of us needless to say she offered awful service and i honestly have no idea how she even had a job in their service industry  she is not a people person at all and must not like her job,negative
jEpTPqsOxic63LmQpGX76g,where do i beginum  gross my husband and i went there based on a recommendation from a local dumpy expensive bad food ordered the special  pork tamale it was fatty and pork was in huge chunks  flavor bad chicken tacos  average at best my husband ordered the shrimp fajitas maybe six shrimp swimming in onions and green peppers this sides were a tsp of sour cream and tsp of quacamole  the refried beans were cold  rice  ok expensive and less than mediocre we were not pleased our combined total was over 40 we would have done better getting food from a street vendor  tucked in between strip clubs i would recommend skipping past,negative

3nYIq4THGUOgQCAF-mkd7w,worst inexcusable service  local herehad attempted dinner here years ago and due to a long wait and rude hostess we never returneduntil recently first they were not crowdedmaybe 6 or 7 tables tops we waited thirty minutes on very simple cocktails you know something is wrong when you have to grab another waiter since yours has disappeared into thin air to ask where are our drinks  to which he replies oh sorry we're really busy and the bartender is backed up backed up we could've walked across the street to juan's and ordered margaritas to go and had them in less than 5 mins here's the absolute worst part when the drinks finally arrived they smelled like a wet dog which means the glasses were dirty gag we decided to finish our appetizer of guacamole and bail but needed more chips they give you 4 large chipsyes you read that correctlyfour chips we asked for more chips and the bill they had the absolute nerve to charge for extra chips  i don't care how good the food is i will never return,negative
3YqUe2FTCQr0pPVK8oCv6Q,unfortunately our recent visit was quite disappointing apparently the columbia is not maintaining the high standards of service and food quality for which they have been known for example i don't expect to be initially greeted by my waiterserver as hey boss man it just doesn't set the tone for the type of dining experience one would expect from a restaurant with a reputation for upscale dining secondly with the many appealing entrée choices on the menu we followed the server's recommendation for  a selection of grilled fish it was just that fish cooked on a grill nothing more in fact both were over cooked and a rather small portion the potatoes  vegetables were room temperature at best all in all there was nothing special  about the food or the service and we left disappointed,negative
EuKJQJk56lgGR-4uv4Sukw,went to grab a sandwich because honestly the sign made it look reputable they burnt the bun still served it as a to go order chicken was tasteless and just torn to shit and didn't come with sauce or anything but lettuce and old tomato and onion dissapointing i wont be back,negative
uZsStnH9w2xY15og9VsQZA,so i actually live here and try to eat here and the staff is never amazing but tonight is at an all time low if you want to sit outside on the new patio they created after the shooting and get a pizza salad and martini's it all comes from other places my husband had to walk to the pizza place that is connected and actually order the pizza and get it himself while we waited for martini's in an outside unpacked bar for over 10 minutes only find that the drinks come from inside weird terrible who owns this place in ybor shame on you used to be so better so unfortunate,negative
mXNJzDD54cefU3DNIVi5hA,after driving over 600 miles from iowa my boyfriend and was super hungry so we stop to get food from here we had been to several cracker barrels in north carolina and were highly satisfied with their food and service however this particular cracker barrel was just the opposite of our previous experiences i ordered french toast with apples turkey sausage and hash browns my apples contained some kind of black substance and my hash browns was barely warm my boyfriend ordered pancakes bacon cheese grits sausage and eggs his bacon came out raw when he requested it to be extra crispy also his cheese grits contained some kind of sweet seasoning that was not listed in the menu description after waiting for all the food to be corrected all of our other food items were cold our server was kind but not really helpful at correcting the issue we had to request to speak to the manager whom offered us 50 off of our bill i will never go back here again,negative
uHtdM9fh6h4F0Ly3X3ez0Q,disappointed overpriced and not very good  tapas were hit or miss flat bread waa burned black octopus was good paella was so salty it could not be enjoyed and much of it was not eaten  branzino was good and enjoyed by the two who ordered it our party of six was comped with two desserts because of the paella one of which was an  overly salted caramel dessert won't go back,negative
OmJnaVUJH9EVR-TYldv4JA,horrible place don't even think about going here the waiter had such a bad attitude never cared to check on us even once and was very rude to us when he even got us our food the person who welcomed us also had no smile and was unfriendly about the food it is way below average you can get better stuff for much lower price with much better service elsewhere,negative
gnpyyeWQ53WlDMJEq-YA_w,i'm not kidding but seriously my stomach hurts after eating wagyu i didn't even wrap it up to give it to a homeless yes it is that bad the server was intense which is kinda rude i gave him 0 dollars cause he deserved it i won't recommend it to anyone,negative
grpNey31cTGKrhmQQaNGdA,old santa fe    vs  new santa feit is very hard for me to write this review as i don't enjoy writing bad reviews especially when it is for one of my past favorite restaurants it is important to understand the reason for my negative review is mainly for value received and a disappointment in comparison of the traditional basque style of diningfirst i will give a little history of the old santa fe and also a little of my experience of basque style dining we lived in california but have been coming often to the area to frequent local basque restaurants we have come a lot to jt in gardnerville since 1970 as it is one of our favorites we visited the overland and even the ormsby house in carson city when they had a basque style restaurant when we visited reno we visited louie's and then also discovered the santa fe hotel and it immediately became one of our favorites we then moved to reno and became regulars at the santa fe there were usually four of us who ate there regularly each week and sometimes we also brought our family members there on sundays we would always bring friends visiting from out of town here as welli mentioned the main reason for my negative review was for value received and also nontraditional basque style amenities as to the value issue the past santa fe usually had a choice of five or six different main entries and the complete meal was 1900 it included all the traditional basque style items including a choice of a second main course side entree sometimes it was tongue lamb paella spaghetti or chorizo each person could pick what second side dish they wanted all other basques restaurants also offer a second side but most have only one item which is different each night santa fe was one of the few that gave you a choice the new santa fe does not offer a second side dish at all as do all other basque style restaurants which was a major disappointmentas i had stated you had a choice of four or five items for 1900 as a comparison of the old santa fe vs the new a new york steak that was 19 is now 3500 which is an 84 increase lamb was 19 and now it is 3700 a 94 increase chicken is even 28 now my point and my major disappointment is this amount of increase puts it way out of the category as a family style basque restaurant and also is much higher that other comparable basque style restaurants added to this much higher price was the missing second side dish as wellwhen we learned in 2017 that the santa fe was closing we did a lot of research trying to find out about any reopening there were many rumors and we finally heard in may of 2019 it was scheduled to reopen and the news was it was going to stay the same for the most part but cleaned up the opening was then delayed till july and we could not wait to go there on our first visit was when we were shocked at the high prices the missing second side dish the small serving bowls the salty salad and no coffee we were assured that all suggestions would be taken into account and items changes where neededwe went back a second time in hopes of them having changed what was needed there still was no second side dish still the same high prices they even raised the steak from 34 to 35 the salad was improved and the bowls were a little larger but all in all still a major disappointment summary this was one of our favorite restaurants we ate here weekly and also brought friends and family we really want it to succeed with the high price and the low value compared to all other basque restaurants we don't see how it can continue operating this way i had thought they would have realized the need for a major price adjustment and an adjustment on what was included in the meal to even offer a less expensive steak like a sirloin 24 to 26 would be a start i can't imagine going to a basque style restaurant with your friends and family and paying 35 for a meal compared to 19 to 25 by the way they did an excellent job on the interior and redoing the bathrooms which is a huge improvement the staff was all very friendly and the service was excellent i am sad to say that we will not be back unless we hear there were some major changes,negative

a39Bc7eixUE1_vOkBjEfwg,honestly really disappointed paid 250 for this deviled crab that was a bread ball of chopped onions you would see on your mc donald's hamburger there wasn't one piece of crab meat in it and i got the shredded beef and it was super dry tasting  paid 1647 in total for food that just wasn't good ,negative
TXoxXn3IETBBJxZQMQK3rw,last time i ate at la casona and it's been about 2 years now i ordered the pollo relleno a la casona and it made me incredibly sick i had ordered mofongo in previous ocassions and it was good service was very slow too and it seems it hasn't change based on recent reviews i have read on yelp,negative
pRF-yUpOG2YbzA767CLqQQ,rice and beans is simply that  rice and beans and nothing more i think it's important to you as the reader for me to start off from the beginning of the visit to this establishment i came in and it looked a bit odd the entrance wasn't inviting at all but that may just be me i felt it at the moment of me parking that everything was off if and when you read other reviews about this restaurant please know that all the one star reviews are indeed accurate and not at all a lie or an exaggeration there seems to be a labor shortage and the restaurant cannot perform at full capacity this restaurant shouldn't really be open for this long of a time if they cannot serve the customers appropriately and on top of that  good food the food was horrible dry and tasteless our waitress was busy talking to a table for over 10 minutes having a flirtatious conversation without tabling other tables the entire service was done in a span of 2 hours we came in at around 1 in the afternoon and we finished at around 3 almost 4 on top of all that time being wasted the food i ordered was cold hard and dry as a dominican woman it's very sad to have wasted calories on this plate and eating food that's not even hard to make the bill was 100 dollars and all wasted on a two hour service that wasn't even great as a person who loves food very much this visit made me glum the food was distasteful the waitress was rude when told we didn't like the plates nor the drinks and the atmosphere was intense children screaming at the top of their lungs and no one telling them to chill out it's insane i highly recommend not coming here and i know that if you do come you'll be just as sad as i am,negative

nrep-epDhpYB3bDCVGdIag,i love mexican food so i was very excited to try vida unfortunately i was very disappointed  my boyfriend and i started with the vida guacamole it came out promptly but was loaded with crumbled cheese on top the menu did not state it had cheese and my boyfriend has a dairy allergy when i finally tasted it i was disappointed to find that it had no tomatoes onions cilantro or any other ingredient found in guacamole besides avocado and there seemed to be very little avocado as well the guacamole tasted like sour cream at best i know you can cut guacamole with sour cream to make it smoother but this was all sour cream  for dinner we ordered the habbenaro chicken wings chicken taquitos shredded pork tacos and mahi mahi tacoshabbenaro chicken wings came out with the same crumbled cheese on top no mention of this on the menu and they looked great in reality they did not taste like much of anything they had no heat but were oddly sweet every other bite i got a hint of black pepper but over all they were gooey and devoid of flavorchicken taquitos the tortilla was very thick it may have been home made which i give them credit for attempting but it was much too thick and doughy  the only thing i could discern inside was the chicken no texture no depth of flavor just smoked chicken over all the dish was mushy and one notemahi tacos the fish was fried which again was not stated on the menu despite being covered in what looked like ranch chipotle sauce this too had no flavorshredded pork tacos my boyfriend asked for no cheese these came out with a puddle of white cheese wiz on them they had pickled onions which was a nice touch and i was happy to find some texture in at least one dish but overall the only thing we could taste was pork and onionsoverall the food was overwhelmingly bland there was no citrus or tomatoes in any over the dishes that i tasted and the presentation was poor  finally when it came time to pay i was told their computer wasn't working and was instructed to write my credit card number expiration date and signature on a piece of paper so they could run it later there was no sign on the door saying that they did not accept cards and no one told us when we sat down or made the reservation that their machine was not working that was unacceptable and their method to take my card info was unacceptable as well  i had to leave to go to an atm and come back to pay cashoverall it was a poor show of mexican food and management,negative

S8ZFYEgMejpChID8tzKo9A,stopped in for lunch on restaurant week pretty establishment hosts were very polite food was good when it eventually showed up the items all came out of order which seems weird the main courses came in randomly and then an appetizer then a main course again two of the selections never came we told the waiter and he apologized and the manchego cheese eventually came out not sure how three slices of cheese and honey could take longer than anything else to come out dessert was the same ordeal it never came out again complained and eventually that came out too waiter apologized and said he would comp our drinks and take it off the bill never did the food was great but the service was off at every step also the bartender kept coughing all over the fruits he was cutting,negative
S8ZFYEgMejpChID8tzKo9A,took friends from out of town here for dinner last night and what a disaster i don't know what was going on with their cooling system but it was so unbearably hot that it ruined our experience sweat was literally pouring out of our bodies as we tried to eat our expensive dinner we had to cut the meal short and go somewhere else it was so bad this has always been one of our favorite places but the food wasn't as good as we've had in the past either i know jose garces is going through some difficulties and it showed at the restaurant last night not sure we'll ever go back,negative
jEpTPqsOxic63LmQpGX76g,we went on the reccomendation of a local we are not sure why the tamale was served it seemed commercial an microwaved the service was slow like you will get it mañana not authentic or good  all you would be better off to go to felipe's the service and food is way better,negative
vSS_H_9mEARWnQe7NtFNSg,contigo was not so great  they were out of two of things i tried to order  the wrong food was brought out to our table twice  the appetizer took about 20 minutes to get to the table and the mains followed less than 10 minutes after the app's were dropped  the food that did come was disappointing striking one note  costillo estofado shorts ribs was braised nicely but lacked any depth of flavor the vegetables of green and yellow squash were soggy and the fries plain  chuletas lamb chops hit one note and featured the same exact vegetables fries  i would not go back,negative

YqjGRqPL0roLE5EO6nf3UA,mediocre food with a great view you enter the restaurant downstairs and walk past an interesting and colorful mural to get to an elevator to take you to the second floor and restaurant i came here for sunday brunch i ordered a spinach salad with beets and blue cheese the waitress comes back from the kitchen to tell me they are out of beets and they sub apples and candied pecans the salad is good but is salty in the dressing and compounded by the blue cheese i also ordered the garlic soup which was tasty but also salted with a heavy hand i did enjoy watching the riverboats and other ships cruise the mississippi river while i dined but the burn in my mouth from too much salt made me not want to come back,negative

F3bzaJzhvsWPD3JQYSqrwQ,does not deserve one star  everything about this place is terrible i came here with some cuban friends who were in town visiting everything from the atmosphere to the service was terrible they look at you like you have 5 heads while you wait 45 mins for food instead of offering a water or maybe greeting you also over 40 for 3 sandwiches is way too steep the sandwiches had paper thin steak on two pieces of bread and nothing else absolutely the worst cuban restaurant experience ever tropicuban cafe on 54 ave n is close by with way better food and atmospherethe reason we tried this place was because they were open on sunday should have checked the reviews and pictures before we went lesson learned,negative
QqvMMaeNJqaEJihkhdYiAQ,my husband and i went to eat dinner with my friends i'm from spain madrid and 3 of my friends too the food was really really good i feel like i was in spain againthe tapas are really good  we ordered paella and solomillo al cabrales  the solomillo was amazing the wine really good beer good we were having a good time except for the service since we seat  the gentleman in charge of our table treated us really really bad  if we ask him cordially his answers a few times were like  come on give me a break men  he said all kinds of things during the night we ask him for the bill and we give him really little tip and also our fault we write on the tip that he doesn't deserve anything because he treats us really bad so after that we went to the street been ready to go homehe went out of the restaurant and tell us that we should never write this againwe told him that he deserves for treat us very bad and he answered screaming  what you should do is come back to your fucking country so we will never come back there  we will not accept  and support racist behavior,negative
wYdlP6g2y6gK_RmLrPhsGA,lola's has excellent food but i think the place has gotten two small for the large number of people it serves nightly the place is so cramped your libel to get claustrophobia which is why i recommend eating outside if you can i was riding my bike passed here today and the food smelled so good i placed a togo order for paella i knew it was going to be at least a thirty minute wait which gave me time to ride back to the marigny where i was parked get my car and by the time i come back to lola my food would be ready i stopped a couple of times on the way back to my car and by the time i got to lola it was an hour since i had placed my order to my dismay when i got there my order was still not ready infact it was in the middle of cooking as i could see the dish being prepared in the kitchen being very hungry and not wanting to wait in that cramped place longer than i had to feeling like a bull in a china shop i left to be honest i can't fault them for not having my order ready as they were very busy but my recommendation would be to not have togo orders at all or suspend them when you have a large crowd its insane to make a person wait over an hour for food,negative
CGVpuQ3FpPWyYFQJQlsjLQ,always excited to try new places downtown this replaced the fly bar same deal great drinks not so good food service was great over and beyond great but the food was terrible being pricey made it all the more horribleall items came to our table unbelievably table fast not sure if that's a good thing now octopus cold no flavor 2 bites and slid plate away shrimp flavorful sauce but cold chicharrones we ate them but thought  they would be true chicharrones as a 10 tapa turned out to be a 089 bag of pork rinds from 711 dumped in a bowl recommendation would be for chef and owners to take a step back and reevaluate their menu and recipes they're missing such a great opportunity as for your choice in staff you rocked it,negative
EmBa8UWYRwM_3hagkqwtIg,well im from the east for many years and have eaten in two weeks the lobster specials on thursday the dinners are very expensive starting at 40 dollars per person  the lobster is a bit overcooked and a bit tough and no butter is included to dip the lobster which is an eastern way to eat lobster i will say the fried lobster tacos were delicious the baked potatoes are wy under cooked and the steaks are not properly cooked if you want medium rare i spent in two weeks 2 eves what it cost me for groceries in a month i was excited at first but now im not  toomuchmoney and really not up to par if they are going to offer lobster the chef needs to know how to truly cook and offer lobster,negative
_mdDAxk-O96OP35XdEfUTA,stopped in for a quick bite during themiddle of the day the place was empty except for two other diners not a good signi ordered at the counter in spanish with the surly waitress i really don't know if i should have switched to english  i ordered the el pibe hot dog which was very large and tasty in a weird waythe actual dog is not kosher that's for sure and not of the best qualitythe toppings were of interest shredded chicken pieces of bacon a thick pineapple juice stay with mesome sort of cheese garlic sauce and  ketchup it's sounds like a disaster a travesty of the american hot dog but it's not it's colombian so when in romethe pibe dog worked out well and the flavors combined well it came with thick french fries that tasted great dunked in the extra pineapple andketchup i always wanted to try it but don't see myself coming back for morethis place is more of a regular colombian restaurant with a few hot dog items essentially gets you in the door  a gimmick,negative
59MEnlgqB-1q1R2h4XyuMw,no no a thousand times no a friend dragged me here saying that his friend told him that the place is amazing parking wasinteresting they literally have 5 spaces ended up parking on the side of the building illegal i dunno walking inside it seems like it hasn't been updated in a long time a plus is that the waitress was really friendly and attentive she brings us salsa in a bottle oo shocking and this refried bean dip with melted cheese on top the salsa was meh had to question whether it was made in house or not because it just wasn't flavorful the bean dip was good but it was nothing i'd ever pay for i end up ordering the austin special which was 1 cheese and 1 chicken enchilada two taquitos with beans and guacamole on the side friend orders a chimichangaenchiladascheese enchilada was just ok not filled with a yuuge amount of cheese but enough to taste it chicken omg maybe the worst thing i've ever had at a restaurant the chicken was mushy in places and the taste was completely offrefried beans tasted like chili from a can not something i'd expect to be served at a restaurant would be great on a random hot dog though taquito probably the best thing on the plate tasted like the frozen variety thoughguac tasted like the packaged kind not memorablei ask the waitress for hotsauce since there is none on the table and she says that they don't have any except tabasco whaaaaat whhyyyy what kind of mexican restaurant doesn't have at least tapatio shameful she was nice enough to check the kitchen to see if they have any but they don't i absolutely needed it to mask the flavor of that chicken enchilada friend let me have a bit of his chimichanga and it was just ok maybe 23 stars this is easily the worst mexican restaurant i've ever been to i wouldn't recommend this place to anybody i feel like i paid way too much for what i got as a matter of fact i could do way better in my own personal kitchen ,negative
LPzt4zjwSSJnqmhFIyx-bA,here for a concert next door and went to the bar to get a drink and the a hole bartender was a real jerk called me boss and told me to move as he had a vague and stupid line system no one could figure out what an ass now i have no interest to even try the food and certainly did not order a drink just walked out thanks boss,negative
S-pwdOmtIPL2UCjQEvKROg,had high high hopes for fodder  shine since greg and michelle baker's first restaurant the refinery is one of my alltime favorites but this new crackerstyle cuisine needs some work so i'll preface this by saying fodder  shine opened four days ago but given the pedigree behind the scenes here i was expecting betterin baseball it's three strikes and you're out here i think we had at least fourthey were out of the draft beer i ordered and the gimlet i ordered instead was just okay my gf's drink was so bad the jardin  bitter horrible aftertaste at one point she said it tastes like nailpolish remover i had to take it back to the bar and ask them to fix it and even after that it may have been the first cocktail i've never seen her finishwe ordered grilled oysters for an appetizer and they were so chewy it was like that piece of bubblegum you had in your mouth for over an hour you couldn't even taste the sauce they were finished with  and your jaw hurt by the time you were done with a few of themi ordered sirloin steak tips the server came back to me after 20 minutes and told me that they were out of it asked if i wanted the much more expensive steak instead felt like i was being upsold or it was a bait and switch act said no and got my second choice the fried chicken instead the food finally arrived one hour and 40 minutes after we were first seated when the chicken came sadly it was so tiny and overly breaded and not at all filling and the whole time i just couldn't help but thinking of yardbird's the gold standard in florida fried chicken and comparing the two nope no comparisonthe two side dishes i ordered were barely warm by the time they finally got to me and one of them the tomato gravy was essentially like dumping a jar of tomato sauce over minute rice luckily the roasted zucchini slices were hard to mess up so we devoured thosemy gf's quail was so tiny it maybe had three bites of meat on it and the side of radishes seemed to be missing the sofkee was cold and underseasoned it tasted like bland grits or porridge final bill with tip was almost 100 and we are on our way to get ice cream right now because we are starving,negative

NPn7gyFOlJXv6vhcLU_llw,i was looking forward to sunday brunch at patanegra when we walked up at 1230 the place looked closed the outside tables had not been set up yet we tried to get inside and the door was locked we could see people inside and were then directed back to the entrance only to find it still locked we ordered the sangria which was very good the sample ceviche which 2 of the three were bland the ceviche is served with banana chips not my thing i guess we did have the dates they were great lastly we had the potatoes which were pretty good service was good we were the only ones in the place and the employees were all sitting at the bar including the chef i don't think i would recommend this place,negative
uZsStnH9w2xY15og9VsQZA,service was meh food was disappointing 16 linguini with muscles and the muscles weren't even in the shell which is suspicious the restaurant had 10 open tables but the wait to be seated was still 10 minutes,negative

5X43mcuo8-oq9NUZi5m7Jg,lol used to a bottle mix seems like your goto response for the other reviews pertaining to the same problem i assure you i am not used to a bottle mix i have had plenty of delicious fromscratch margaritas and bottle mixed margaritas the caliber of deliciousness of your restaurant's particular creation did not even come close to what i've experienced before actually it didn't really even taste like a margarita just tequila lime and and seltzer this could be a problem with that particular bartender but i expected better from a restaurant named after this style of drink,negative
-nFhHFySIOCBQW4-zHtnHw,old food this place is a joke i don't usually write reviews but with this place i had to rice was a least 2 days old plantains old and the meat full of fat do not waist your money oh by the way i also got sick after eating churrasco and arroz amarillo,negative
28s9c6Ibf9cgC7c8Szo6WQ,very disappointed spent over 80 here 5 devil crab 5 stuffed potatoes and some cuban sandwiches the devil crab i don't know what they put in it but this was the absolute worst i've ever had in my life not to mention all 5 were burnt see pics have some pride in the food you serve the stuffed potatoes tasted like burnt fryer grease the sandwiches were at least edible i ordered the food to go and lesson learned always check your food before you leave,negative
TJaImyntBu0ebKugcyj6eQ,i was excited when i saw action stirring in the wondow of the little corner property that sat vacant for ages at the corner of 26th and pine nestled brilliantly on the edge of the park that is home to a playground tennis and bball courts a dog park community gardens and a baseball field on the side it was meant for success unfortunately it isn't the homey neighborhood haunt that i was hoping it might become          the concept of quality products one village coffee baker street bread and boar's head deli meats and a dedication to purity beans roasted delivered and ground within days isn't enough to keep me as a customer the decor is beautifully done  but i didn't feel comfortable there         for a spot where there are a lot of kids and dog people and high foot traffic not only from foot commuters and the future prospect of the pedestrian bridge that will be there in a couple years the idea of 10 sandwiches and salads seems ludicrous to me if i want a cup of coffee and possibly something for lunch and i spot a cafe i'm not really expecting a 15 tab when all is said and done  i don't care how good the quality is i had wanted this to be a laid back fun happy hangout  but instead it was made into a gourmet stop who would rival regular restaurants in cost            will i get coffee there sometimes sure it's convenient to my home and one village coffee is good stuff but a 910 sandwich or salad no and as far as vegetarianfriendly the farthest gavin's goes is a cheese plate and a couple selections that include goat cheese which is all well and good but with the focus on boar's head it's clear that vegheads won't be hanging around         ho hum i walked in hopeful and more than impressed with the space where they had restored the original bar that existed and a beautiful floor with lovely hanging light fixtures but i would have done things differently and many of my businessminded pals had mouth watering ideas for the spot too  so we shall see what the future holds for this business by default based on location alone she the owner is bound to make bank but not on my dime because really i don't have that many to spare,negative
wYdlP6g2y6gK_RmLrPhsGA,2 stars given for the atmosphere  if you're looking to get out of the main tourist area and experience a local vibe in a beautiful setting this is a great location  the trees the ambience are wonderful  we went for breakfast and we walked away wondering if perhaps they should stick to lunch and dinner  the service was poor  the hostess that welcomed us for our reservation was rude not only to us but other patrons as well  there were 5 of us and half of our party were done eating and left to go for a walk while myself and one other guest still had no food  it was eggs and an omelette  we were apologized to once and said our food would be out in 3 minutes  20 minutes later we rushed through eating an average breakfast so we could catch up with friends  the service was poor everyone's food took way too long to get and the breakfast food was average  we would have loved to return for lunch or dinner but after that experience we will not be going back,negative
UYkbkXVD-wK3OhXQrNJTGg,my husband and i really love this place it is a salad place but don't let that deceive you they have great korean food too my husband's go to is the bulgogi kimbap you have to buy two we usually eat one then and save one for later and the soon tofui sometimes go for a more western approach with the bulgogi wrap the japchae is yummy too honestly you can't go wrong if you want some korean food without going to a bbq placethe service is always extremely friendly and helpful too they have patbingsu and slushie style boba milktea honey dew is always a winner in our bookit's a small place but definitely worth the stop ,positive
N29UW_f0SUXEBWHB20hwvw,wow what can i say  the floor show guy pissing in the bushes as we pulled up i thought would set the tone but the meal was wonderful  my family and i never had kbbq prior and the waiters were very helpful walking through everything  we all enjoyed it,positive
qsm7SkX60JsajT7Yz248FA,gonna preface with i'm not a big fried chicken personcame here with a group of 7 and i think we ordered 4 larges 1 spicy 1 fried seasoned chicken 2 soygarlic we thought we called in our order but there seemed to have been some miscommunication or the person on the phone seemed newwe got there and apparently they don't let you call in orders lol luckily it was a monday night and not too busy so the wait wasn't that long to be honest lost track of time which is a good sign right the spicy was a bit too spicy for me i'm kind of weaksauce so i didn't enjoy it that much found the fried seasoned chicken to be too messy part of the reason i haven't been a fan of korean fried chickenbut i was obsessed with the soygarlic between the two larges of the soygarlic that we ordered i think the second was slightly better than the first which came out at the same time as two of the others we'd orderednot sure if that's what made the difference i like the skin crispy but not too crispy that it feels like a shell in a perfect world this place would be closer to the city and the meat would have been more flavorful toowill definitely come back and probably only eat the soygarlic haha,positive
-hto0uJjh8KFQZGc9ZAcuQ,don't let the hole in the wall look of this place faze you the food is unpretentious and delicious the grumpy grandpa who makes the food hardly talks it's kinda weird cause sometimes it's just standing around not sure if he heard you but it's worth it,positive
OzGk7arJv6FPrWqaYSvyKQ,i heard about choi's opening a kitchen back in early fall and have been excited for the day to come i came here saturday night around 625 pm during its first week of opening and it felt pretty busy since the place is so small they had no menu in sight but they told us what they had available i ordered bibimbap and my friend ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl the orders are togothough they had some table space but it was all taken the bibimbap was great i enjoyed the flavor way more than the bibimbap at cafe international it came with all the essential veggies rice and fried egg the order also came with a side of yook soo if i remember the name correctly beef broth overall the food felt very traditional and homemade the cook is great she seemed flustered but i am glad they had a good turnouti am going to come back and try more of the food i asked and she confirmed there is kimbap there is also jajangmyeon spicy pork short rib and possibly more this place has great potential and i am excited to see how it goes for them i would just say they really need to finalize a menu and have it somewhere this is especially important if you have customers who are not familiar with some korean dishes it also would be great if this turned into a sit down restaurant in the futuremostly because i love banchan hahatldr new spot for authentic korean food check it out,positive

5h4M4YhF9H3-6kfXv4eLew,we have been looking for a korean place in the st pete area for so long now that i was delighted to find dooriban i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to satisfy a korean food craving the kalbi here is good  decent portion size and good flavor the japchae is really yummy although a bit greasy those are our main staples when we come here we have also tried the wings spicy the pancake meh and the mandu meh all in all when the craving hits i will definitely come back,positive
-pjWlAzv4qRxB3Gu1D4t6A,i ordered the thai bowl and salad rolls i loved the peanut sauce the thai bowl was good i chose jasmine rice the salad roll fell apart so i gave up trying to eat it but i had good flavor the service was friendly and fairly quick i love the atmosphere i'd come again and would recommend it for a fairly quick and healthy bite to eat,positive

CU75YM3XOAQ4lO12eWdlcA,i have been to sa ri one on four different occasions each time i have loved my food and service has always been good the first time i had jaeng ban ja jang the next time i had the bi bim bob after that i tried the jop chae and the most recent time i had bul go ki chicken my favorite was jop chae but all of them were flavorful portions are large i always have extra for lunch or dinner the next day i'm not a big fan of all the accompaniments they bring though i like the fish cakes and pickled zucchini i personally like all food but asian cuisine is my favorite so take that into account i'm a flexitarian and it's easy to create vegetable dishes and they are nice about modifying the entrees to fit my dietary preferences i recommend sa ri one and i will be back again,positive

u9modXzD6V2Gbpq0YS9W6Q,i have frequented oishi at least 12 times a month since my family moved to pa 14 years ago we love this place the owners are the kindest people and they take note of their regular customers we always get treated so well and the service is fantastic the atmosphere is really unique  they moved locations in the recent years for more space which they definitely neededyou can't go wrong with anything on their menu i've had their noodle dishes rice bowls tempura sushi and teriyaki they've got some really unique specialty rolls and their sushi is always super fresh they also have a lengthy list of kitchen and sushi bar appetizers i have never had a bad meal here if you plan to go here make a reservation they are always booked solid on the weekends so the wait time can climb pretty easily fyi its byob,positive

qc-xhHvmyzyrBAOZUeleig,it was my first time here i was expecting your typical sushi place in south tampa based on its name but surprisingly it's own by koreans and they offer a lot of delicious korean food so we ended up ordering all korean food which came with all the korean small dishes beforehand we had the haemul pajeon seafood scallion pancake which was huge and enough for 2 people to share i had the sundubu jjigae which is spicy tofu stew you can pick beef pork or seafood i picked beef which tasted good but i feel for the spicy tofu hot pot seafood probably pairs the best it's a great remedy if you feel sick overall a solid place and a surprise that it is actually an authentic korean place disgused as a sushi restuarant i actually like this place better than sa ri one,positive
9llupBLdHKFzfawIk6I74w,the best korean bbq i have had in ages the pork bulgogi is my favorite we always bring out of town guests here they are never disappointed,positive

68ThEdiK0eWCEgGEmV9Tng,a great neighborhood gastropub with a spin i live very close to southgate and had been wanting to try it out for some time now on a rainy sunday i figured brunch was the perfect excuse to stop in the space it fairly small with a long bar and about 6 or 7 tables great for groups of 26 although i did see a larger group in the back the decor is dark and reminiscent of a pubkorean soju bar the brunch menu is concise with a good selection of dishes to choose from we got the chicken and waffles short rib loco moco and deviled eggs chicken and waffles was a hit the chicken was flavorful with a crispy cracklin skin a spicy maple syrup or honey drizzle would have been a great addition but then you run the risk of soggy chicken and no one likes soggy fried chicken the matcha waffles were dense and crisp and a good compliment to the chickenmy short rib loco moco was hearty and rich you get a generous portion of soft short rib the rice and pickled jalapenos were a nice offset to the rich egg and meat we were intrigued by the deviled eggs and they were a fun spin on the party classic the kimchi's funkiness cut through the creamy yolks and the whites were soft boiledoverall i'm a fan of southgate it's a great place to take friends for dinner drinks brunch pretty much any occasion,positive
QWqKTWQ2OiDgo3dzNkpung,food is good wide variety of stuff on the menu service is good price is average korean cute interior,positive
z3jfgtlDBww3jTPLosPeew,this is a little restaurant that's kind of hidden someone told me to try it bc its more authentic korean food and i really liked the food and the sides it came with we got the beef  short ribs dumplings and the seafood soup i thought everything was good but my friend thought the seafood soup was too thick we shared that and still had plenty left and the prices were reasonable,positive
oTTx4ObLjOWVCtGXU_8AUw,good first impressions my first time to k pot in philly what is there more to love than a restaurant that combines hot pot and kbbq came here with a bunch of friends who had already ate here before and first impressions were greatfooddrinks in regards to the quality of the food i would it's pretty good for an ayce place you first pick whether you want hot pot kbbq or both afterwards you choose from a menu of all the ingredients you want and the broth if you decide for hot pot if you want my honest opinion doing both hot pot  kbbq is great but you lose track on what you order for which and you'll start mixing the meats though it probably doesn't matter they have a full bar and obviously a soju selection which is great i ordered a long island ice tea for fun which was good and strong though nothing special as with most korean places the soju mixes were good 1 pitcher can give 34 people 23 shots finally they do have a sauce bar for you to make your own saucesserviceenvironment pretty hippy place it has a huge parking lot in front so don't worry about parking i was in a group of 6 and as we were ordering our food they actually started coming out haha server was attentive and wasn't overbearing which was great as with all asian restaurants you can grab other servers very easily and they might be able to help you out even though heshe might not be your serverrating 8510pros decent quality great restaurant with parking hot pot  kbbqcons can be very busy,positive

PJ2FbMY7UpPsAiWtPZGcIQ,here is the deal on this place  it has the best bing soo in st louisi can say that because you can't find this anywhere else  probalby another hidden st louis secret  basically bing soo is the assortment of red beans doughy sweet stuff fruits and shaved ice coupled in a big bowl  they only serve it from may until the hot days of summer die downi didn't even speak about the pastries and baked goods  slightly on pricier side but korean bakeries tend to be mroe pricier  certainly tasty  i have to find some pics to post because i think the interior of the bakery is clean well lit peaceful and i think even has wifi,positive
IbndcMURguByburM72o3SA,love this place the conversation flows early in the morning with the regulars the owner has a wonderful personality i wish the prices were a little lower but it is the main street in newtown afterall if they had veggie meat replacements veggie sausage or fakon my breakfast would be perfect also heard a patron disappointed by a concern i share no dairy replacements to lighten your coffee soy or nut milk would be nicebut overall this place is the greatest small town gem,positive
AwvhobfqOJNBnbXQ_pB3pw,i have to admit  i was surprised with chix  bowls i feel like i've subconsciously avoided it for a while because i thought it was a chain  but i was wrong there are just two locations one in rittenhouse and one at washington square this place is a great restaurant for a quick cheap and relatively healthy meal  especially in rittenhouse where things can get pricey i would recommend bringing cash because most items you order there are just shy of 10 and they have a 10 credit card minimum i got a teriyaki bowl with grilled chicken and chix rice which is is basically yellow rice cooked in chicken broth the grilled chicken was delicious especially with the teriyaki sauce and the vegetables were great overall it was a solid and cheap meal,positive
7FAu3RT5V4baRyePoG-_xw,this is our go to sushi place now if you want to sit down and have dinner with your family where everything comes out at once this is not the place with sushi it comes out when it's ready so you might get yours before your kids get their food or you're sitting waiting for yours while everyone else is eating prices vary depending on what you get i've only had their ramen once and i was very impressed my kids love the ramen too but most of the time they get the teriyaki chicken and rice most of the time we get all you can eat or i just get à la carte  our recommendations for sushi are easy which is a raw roll super spicy  but amazing king kong deep fried deliciousnesshawaiian this one is super yummy with diced fresh mango on top,positive
iryqT-RFwl7erA4MDAuLyg,awesome experience here it's setup like a chipotle assembly line so the line movers fast they have fresh sushi and various sauces to entice your taste buds good service and hip interior adds more flavor to the experience one star was taken out bc of the price and saltiness for amount of food you get,positive
c0TznEkK0x57wbVEepFWrw,crazy good korean barbecue or galbithis one is hidden tucked in a corner without effective signage  i didn't know it was there when first taken by a friend several years ago  it's really exciting when you find good and authentic cuisine in unexpected placeshavent been there in a long while because i had moved well it's still amazing  we even came late not knowing their new open times but the waitress didn't seem to mind  in fact she was energetic hospitable and made us feel very comfortable propsive had korean food in different cities  the food from one family ranks among the best and i have found nothing in tampa that is comparable  take a good look at the attached pictureyes yes yaaassssss,positive
1TUaFvwm24xQo1RIdt1w9g,so happy to have tried the new restaurant oori in chester c pa i've been back several times now and the food and service just keeps getting better the first time i tried oori a friend brought me to the restaurant for a lovely sunday lunch i ordered the house ramen and it was delicious the fried pork was perfect and melts in your mouth the broth tasted fresh and spicy the atmosphere was casual and the decor monochromatic and tasteful but it was loud they could use some sound panels on the walls the service was good and the host was friendly and remembered my friend from the night before i will definitely go back there's so much more to explore on the menu than just ramen since i've been back i've tried the wings and except for my dad's fried chickenhe's from nc i've never had such yummy fried chicken wings crisp and crunchy but not greasy the number of tasty flavors should each be tried they are all amazing one evening we took my youngest son who is a wing aficionado he ordered the wings with a togarashi dry rub when sesame garlic arrived he let the waitress know and she immediately brought the correct order and gave him the wings complimentary to correct the mistake happy accident since they were amazing we have also tried the cabbage salad which we always order it's a perfect compliment to the spicy wings the dan dan noodles are also really good and filling next time bulgogi,positive
-hto0uJjh8KFQZGc9ZAcuQ,there isn't much street appeal to u city its hidden behind cicero's and looks a little dumpy but don't let this fool you the food is amazing i go here pretty frequently for the bulgoki beef which is a simple dish of really well seasoned beef rice and sprouts i sometimes add extra sprouts because they are yummy i've also had the beef vegetable bowl which is more saucy and has other veggies but the bulgoki beef is still my favorite,positive
YQT53_5tc_sp3_Xp4c5Ehw,i know this place has been through a lot especially after the horrifying fire that burned down the building and had it closed for quiet some time however the fire did now stop takamatsu from opening up again they rebuilt the building and brought it back to life they even kept the cat statue that survived from the fire he sits near the sushi chef near a new white cat as he remains his charcoal color as a symbol of his survival they serve sushi here along with korean bbq they also have a karaoke section where you can sing and drink along with friends i have been here before for a friend's birthday about a year ago and i did the kbbq and that was delicious it was the typical kbbq style of cooking and meat choices however the only downfall would have been it wasn't all you can eat i haven't tried the sushi yet so i'm unsure how the quality of sushi is here i did however enjoyed myself with the happy hour time after 930 at the bar drinks are half off and you can just socialize and drink with your friends you can even go karaoke if you wanted to or just drink and enjoy others doing karaoke overall i enjoyed my time here it was a great place to just drink and socialize and i would want to come back and try the sushi next time,positive
tf6S06LD09IFDHUpOPqPaw,being a latina from los angeles i'd like to think i know good tacos this place does not disappoint i got the triple play with two ahi poke and a batter up and both were fantastic pair that with a sunset and kids at the batting cages and it's a great friday evening will definitely come again and bring my friends and fam,positive

ZCZkxo29UKOkKYcxgmwLSA,on the south side of indy this is our favorite korean restaurant to visit very friendly staff and environment they are super generous with the banchan side dishes prices are on the high side but the food quality is good staff may have suggestions for first timers i recommend the meals with short ribs galbi the bulgogi beef is also a safe bet the menu has more for the more adventuroustakeout for covid19 was very easy and convenient,positive
MWdO8vvXEtswuBM4wOgVzw,last week we decided to give sapporo 2 a try and i have to say this was by far far some of the best sushi i have hadour server justin explained the menu in a way we wanted everythingneed to come back for more if you like sushi please go to sapporo 2 you will leave loving it fresh generous and amazing we can not wait to go back to sapporo 2,positive

BnprLJ4Lr33--YjTmgk9Zg,by far the best sushi i have had in philadelphia the rolls are creative and it has a fun energetic atmosphere the yakuza and the triple double spicy tuna are to die for doma is not just for sushi lovers there other dishes are amazing between the doma ramen and stone pot everyone can find something to  love,positive
z3jfgtlDBww3jTPLosPeew,this place is incredible  local koreans swear by it the food is absolutely perfect each and every time and the staff couldn't be friendlier or more efficient a topnotch eatery in music city if ever there was onei'd personally recommend the bulgogi bibimbap or  if you're a fan of spicier foods  the kimchi jjigae a piping hot stew filled with delicious kimchi the traditional fermented cabbage which packs a punch but is a staple with any korean meal  enjoy indulge and trust the staff,positive
z3jfgtlDBww3jTPLosPeew,i just went there for the very first time today and let me tell you it was spiritual i got take out of the kimbap the bibimbap and the kimchi fried rice plus the included sides i'll be honest i wasn't sure what to expect i make most of the korean food i eat at home but a friend told me to check this place out do yourself a favor get some of this grub it's fing astonishingfirst off when i went to pick up the food the whole restaurant smelled incredible so delicious the staff were kind and funny people who were super helpful so thank you when i got home my partner and i devoured this meal the sides man those sides how could they be that good but they are i'm sitting here in tears over how beautiful this meal was i forgot to take photos for yelp oh well next time because there will be a next timeand many morelastly we really only ordered 3 items but it is a ton of food we have 23 full meals worth left because of how much there is bless this fine establishment,positive
ZCZkxo29UKOkKYcxgmwLSA,called ahead and they had everything ready for pickup  as always the food was terrific especiallythe chap chae sisters continues to be our favorite south side restaurant and favorite indy area korean restaurant,positive
MwwCeoby8xfACNV2TpwETg,nice little korean joint tucked away in a strip mall by the oxford valley mall area food is amazing recommend their pajun dolsot bulgogi and yook kae jangif you're in a larger group i'd highly recommend their bbq or their budae jjigae which is a large hot pot that hits the spot on a cold wintry night,positive
HnZCbSY0Ipn8Ydg0Ii8xCg,the food was good but the wait staff could use improvement  monday night and it was slow so we were seated immediately  ten minutes then passed before the server came for our drinks  they seemed to realize they had left us waiting because we were then bombarded by service from our server and the hostess neither of which knew what the other was doingfood came out at a good pace and was pretty good  we had a las vegas roll a samurai roll mackerel nigiri and tempura ice cream  the miso soup was ok the edamame and tempura were great  i was surprised by the samurai roll which contained strawberries but complimented the sweet eel sauce and was very good  the vegas roll had too much cream cheese and i couldn't taste much else  mackerel nigiri was decent but we are in the desert and it was a monday night so quality was understandable  tempura ice cream was tasty and looked very pretty as did everything that came outthe wait staff was very friendly but they need to work on their communication or have better management  i would hate for a good restaurant like this to be bogged down by sub par service but i'll definitely go back for another taste,positive
-6nqH2tdNHQdqb8LvILlBw,had lunch with a friend here  i ordered their smoked eel salad which was very good  david took care of us and let me know that after my glass of sweet tea ran low they had run out of it  so i changed it up for a cocacola  the inside was very festive with holiday decor  and then it hit me i had always eaten outside on the patio without ever coming inside  so it was nice to actually go inside and see it,positive
0z1VO3Js0NdTOKLYDa15zw,this place has been around for many years and has always been absolutely superb try everything on the menu,positive
t7lXDRAytv_pq5FLWSxtaQ,this place is great being korean i come here probably every week cheap gradea produce great kimchi decent marinated meat in korean marinade a variety of korean snacks and frozen products i always get kimchi here and it's consistently great their seafood selection is pretty fresh and cheap compared to other grocery stores there are some places in chinatown that are cheaper but the quality there is very questionable from the smell feel and lookthe only thing missing at this location is that this hmart doesn't have a food court like the other h marts in philadelphia area their prepared food in the store is somewhat lacking both in quantity and quality compared to other places too,positive
v17tgCRjuPQiFOq4uvEI-w,love the authentic korean food my kids and i love eating here you can pick your sides and your protein and starch the hot stone is the favorite,positive
M9yGovzfImwcj31b7BztYQ,loved it relish foodgood service reasonably priced and pretty casual nice menu options,positive
Plgm7jeRg8xbrku_tDitEw,this was such a delightful surprise oh my yum i got the spicy pork bowl and it is so delicious fresh great flavors the meat is perfectly done i tried the three sauces they offer i liked the spicy mayo and loved the wasabi this is definitely worth a stop at the galleria,positive
uRbpWGias7qjP1fBOtcvAA,i was excited to find this place in the new food court area in dt it's so convenient for lunch and deliciousthey serve tacos burritos and quesadillas  probably other things that i don't quite remember now i went with a quesadilla with steak it hit the spot and was so good i also placed an order of fries beware the fries order is good for like 3 ppl  hugeeverything was great for lunch i found my quesadilla was a bit too big so i took it home with me in a togo container my coworker tried the tacos and said they were pretty good as well happy this place is so convenient plan to try it out more often,positive
0bjED1wks9zYFM2386Sn1A,solid spot to pick up a quick but quality meal there aren't any other korean spots in the immediate area so this definitely stands out whether you're looking for something to add to your goto rotation or just looking for a nice takeout meal you should definitely check this place out believe it one of those ghost kitchens that is operating out of poke onotheir bowls are great and filling you should definitely try the different protein and toping options until you find your favorite for me i think the bulgogi and spicy pork are the best not saying this is the best bulgogi but for fast casual food it does a great job also recommend adding the kimchi and bop sauce gochujangthe korean popcorn chicken is really addicting and always hits the spot they're nice a big pieces that keep their crunch even with the gochujanglike sauce on them the mandoo dumplings have a nice crispy outside the vegetable ones are just ok but i enjoyed the chicken ones more,positive
aU1YYBZJOus8scypsqJ2_g,very friendly staff and wonderfully delicious food  service was quick and portions were very generous,positive
o1DuWXCV_kg_mSqNOxUdew,already been here a few times each time the experience has been great great customer service the owner not only greets but also helps staff staff not just the waitress constantly hacks to make sure everything is good from changing grill to filling up water and ordering more meats andor sides husband and i decided to go for father's day today they were really busy so there was quite a wait but was still worth it they're all about customer service and keeping customers happy there was a not our waitress girl who helped out tremendously and was very nice kept smile on her face and water in our glasses very friendly i think her name was courtney,positive
cKMGS2Agns1ySTeWiFqMoA,visited yesterday with my daughter ordered 3 dishes to go and all were great it was very difficult to smell their aroma in the car and not dive in somehow i needed some special help finding particular items in the store and the lady working there the owner was extremely helpful and courteous the place isn't on my side of town but i will be trying to find reasons to drop in again soon,positive
b1pdnbYvBdtTxJOOom5WmA,so good this place hits the spot every time chicken is always freshly prepared and the flavors are two thumbs up the best way to eat andy's is to sit in the store at one of the picnic tables while your order is pipping hot crunchy delicious happiness,positive
bn2jWrB_aXdQP4YoyUVVIQ,i really love this place i've been ordering delivery once or twice a week over the last few months which is terrible for my wallet but so extremely rewarding for my taste buds soondubu and jajangmyun are my favorites i used to live in nyc and went to ktown often but when i moved here i realized philly doesn't have as many options for korean food so it's a blessing that this place exists it's consistently good and satisfying food that's reasonably priced what's not to love,positive
o1DuWXCV_kg_mSqNOxUdew,very fun all you can eat korean bbq place while in town for the night we decided to try ijji 4 after searching for restaurants near our hotel we were seated right away and continued to have friendly and prompt service all night would highly recommend,positive
KFCxKvsEoJvTMY1J7Nno2Q,we came here for my daughter's free birthday dinnerhas to be on the day of n proof of id love this place we went on a weekday so it wasn't crowded the staff was friendly and very attentive to our needs everything we ordered was all there the meat was well marinated for the bbq the only thing i wasn't too happy about was their headless shrimp i like whole shrimp when eating hot pot place was well decor and spacious they have more sauce option than nine ting in philly chinatown this will be our goto for hot pot and korean bbq instead of philly,positive
WSgZHMgW6CI62QTJik53AA,kimchi and cheese together is a genius and tasty combination try the burritos or tacos or quesadillas for the best fusion flavors very fresh and flavorful pico de gallo and salsa or the bowls or kimchi fried rice or bibimbap for more traditional asian flavors it's a small storefront but very clean and welcoming napkins and giant bottles of sriracha on each table offers the usual soda along with fitz's root beer and some craft ginger beer the kimchi is also really well fermented and excellent,positive
rwDq9kqpKvs01wLbOTHzKw,just moved to indy and looking for our new go to restaurants we have tried about 10 so far and all of them were average thrilled to report that tian fu was great we will definitely be retuning often we decided late sunday night to try their peking duck make sure to call ahead if you want to try too 30 minutes later we arrived and they had it ready for us it was great the rest of our selections were tasty as well we will make this a usual stop for us when we are tasting chinese,positive
h2-mPUMYJ5pF_gVurDL3lw,not your regular sushi buffet as this is a bbq restaurant with your choice of unlimited meats that you cook at tableside yourself for 3 more  the sushi is standard sushi but if you want to get more exotic they have sushi chefs who will create sushi of your choicevery attentive service and food was fresh and was very good  i would make it a point to eat here again,positive
2E5fh57OvOQMWwxxEOkN8A,we came here just to see what it was about friends had been the other day and encouraged us to try it we were not let down to say the least all ofthe meats were very well seasoned and the staff was very helpful even teaching us how to eat the shrimp the traditional way i will say not all of us sucked the shrimp heads but we had a couple of brave souls the prices were good and we will be back to try some of the dinner items,positive
kg6yWp6MJPCMw0kT4l3O6A,great bulgogi bibimbap yaki mandu bubble tea drinks and coffee drinks good portions and fresh vegetablesingredients  comparable taste and quality to what you can find in hawaii and korea friendly family owned operation i see they are offering spam and eggs breakfast and spam musubi i'll come back and try that when i'm missing hawaii,positive
IsmxvaMe2i-eWnHDyC0WJQ,hot stone bibimbap is my new obsession i dream of the crispy rice on the bottom of the bowl and the hot sauce that comes with this i'd stlil say giwa is my preference but rice  mix is much roomier for eating in and much more convenient to my office clean friendly quick service this place is a winner,positive
1QCZS_3x7_JLekGJAqnhMQ,food was great fully flavor but not too muchportion is good maybe need some more rice with iteven we have to wait for little long and we start getting upset but the food make the bad mood gone in secondonly one things that i have to take 1star out is the togo order they forgot rice with the bibimbup only condiment in the bag so sad,positive

HTgKfmmlzgE43trhntv8-w,stopped by with a few friends on a sunday night for dinner there was no wait and we were seated right awaywe decided to start off with some appetizers we got the haemul pajeon seafood pancake and goon mandoo fried dumplings the small size of the pancake was more than enough for 3 people and delicious my friend who is vegan was able to eat the fried dumplings as they were vegan we each got our own tofu stew which came with a side of rice i tried the seafood tofu stew which included shrimp mussels and other seafood the tofu was soft and the broth was very flavorful i got the spicy level which had a good kick to it but not overwhelmingly spicy they were able to make a water based tofu stew for my vegan friend which was awesome she did mention though her stew was a little bland the interior was nice and the service was great our server was friendly and knowledgeable about each dish and the ingredients also our dinner was very affordable as we felt that we got a lot of food for the price covidwise everyone in the restaurant was wearing masks overall loved it here and will definitely be coming back soon,positive
w-4oUyYk-0wN3Gg0YN4M9g,this place is great for a fun time and food their prices are reasonable and you can cover the hourly fee with food ex if your room costs 78 per hour you can order 78 worth of food from the menu to make it worth it my only complaint is that the karaoke systems are difficult to use it takes a while to figure out how to find specific songs mute the original singer's voice for solely instrumental and how unorganized it becomes when you realize to find new songs you can only scroll a list and not type it into the search engine additionally the serves will not alert you as to how much money you have left to spend on food to match up to the karaoke room price i guess this is a smart way for them to maximize their profits but still lastly the bathrooms are pretty dirty each karaoke room has a private bathroom which is convenient and great but due to the excessive drinking that occurs puke stains remain from previous sessions and the servers should be much more attentive to this issueoverall the atmosphere is very trendy and the service is adequate they should be more aware of the complaints mentioned above though,positive
ZDdNEwBENLXBT3jjQD5STQ,fast  fresh and delicious love their food and seating is nice soon as u walk in ur know ur some where different,positive
xQ2hGUt62iZr5Gc3PrASYg,this place is pretty awesome it's a spin off of pf changs bistro and just like pfs this place is delicious only reason i left 1 star off is the food still isn't as good still as what pf changs is and it's a little pricey other than that this place is pretty awesome they have friendly staff too just a side note the coke machines are like nothing you've ever seen they have big touch screens and like a bazillion drink combinations,positive
KFCxKvsEoJvTMY1J7Nno2Q,i've heard of meat sweats before but i've always thought this was an exaggerated myththis is no mythi was heading to another korean restaurant that i hadn't been before when i saw the ten hot pot sign and i swerved into the parking lot i had never been to an ayce korean bbq beforeafter being seated i was given the run down by the host and the server i got the bbq and hot pot combo i chose my broth and meats for boththen out comes the appetizers kim chi diced daikon edamame and a couple other palate pleasers that i can't remember  out comes the meats and it's a lot of it the server lights the grill and adjust the hot pot heat and left me grill and cook away i got several cuts of pork beef and some seafood when you read ayce you think you can put away a lot and enjoying it i couldn't make it anywhere near the two hour limit that's given i ordered a second selection of different meats and pretty much regretted it i stayed about an hour and fifteen minutes an enjoyable 1hr 15 mini left stuffed and ready for a napas much as i thought i could eat plenty of these thinly sliced meats i really couldn'tmaybe this is something i could try annually but definitely not on a regular basis,positive
g6YU9lV-caYDhiPJviIMeQ,i love this place it's close to my house and there's a section of the menu with all of the cooked sushi which is especially nice for pregnant people the sushi is always delicious i are at the bar for the first time last week and they made my orders super fast and they were really nice,positive
-pyobEWdpZ6jUp42f3I2xw,love this place  my wife and i hit this place up a couple times a month  the spicy pork and chicken bulgogi all day long  service is great as well  it gets busy but we've never really had to waiti believe they now have a 2nd place in philly but i haven't made it there yet,positive
v17tgCRjuPQiFOq4uvEI-w,food is great we're familiar with korean motherinlaw is korean and other than the chicken very mildly flavored we were very impressed   i had bibimbap husband had kalbi plate son had chicken and rice  we wondered before coming what the portion sizes would be like they were large  the amount of veggie sides was generous location was easy to find restaurant was clean service was satisfactory not as fast as chipotle but we never expected it to be since they're having to educate people on what items weresuggestion  label the sides in english and korean name korean name in english not korean characters so people know what they're asking for and educate them at the same time,positive
7PbJjm9Oeq9LqM9zKsF-8g,this place is very good my parents love galbi tang they usually get their galbi tang from ktown in la and they said this was as good or even better food was affordable and delicious the service we received was actually very impressive i highly recommend this place a gem of a restaurant,positive
6n1m1XaSqZcGsBUige13rA,i love this place for the genuinely awful experience  for about 4 months we made it out once a week like clockwork  so keep in mind that this awfulness is the sum of 16 consecutive visits  and every time was a new kitchen nightmare  but i am a korean and needed some korean food yo  kimchi pancake is insane the consistency of funnel cake with all the grease  korean soups can get pretty funky but holy dirty dishwater this place takes the cake  the service is amazing  to give you an example on a slow night for the restaurant we spent about two hours here on two courses a quick app and dolsot bibimbop and at the end of the night our server said so how was it  pretty bad service huh  hell yeah it was so bad it was awesome  i think we waited at least 25 minutes for a glass of water and menu  another time the entire restaurant and market were being operated by the husband and wife team  she in the kitchen while her husband a nice caucasian dude washed dishes took orders struggled with korean pronunciation stocked market shelves and delivered food all at the same time and while competing in his own personal wet tshirt contest  that was another 2 hour dinnerhonestly it's a 2 star experience  okay 1  but the effort is so there and experience is so unusually unfortunate that i gonna have to stick with 4 stars  i may return one day,positive
_k1CIuPkY-uLFm8lABFG8Q,came in at around 730 on a friday night for a party of 2 we had the option to sit at the bar on the first floor rather than wait for a table the atmosphere was nice though it was hard to hear one another over the kpop which turned into a funny distraction if anythingwe ordered s soy garlic wings and s sweet wings both 14 in addition to a pitcher of angry orchard 20 soy garlic had an awesome garlic taste but something missing maybe salt or pepper would definitely order again regardless the sweet wings were also good though the flavor wasn't particularly game changing both wings had a good crunch and left us both very filled the order comes with a side of cubed radishes which definitely helped the garlic breathbonchon is a pretty solid kfc staple so you can't go wrong with coming here to catch up with friends,positive
xh7mQ46QUMswpugKJFmppQ,this is a new korean restaurant opened just a month ago and do see the business is doing alright  the stone bowl bibimbap is the best in the area  it is more authentic than the one i normally go to  mandu is also great  there is also a nice outdoor seating area with game stations  the service is excellent and seating is ok  from other reviews this place took over from another restaurant  perhaps it is not originally for bbq just one table having bbq the place is very smokey as the exhaust wasn't great  my clothes soaked with all the bbq smoke from just one table  also the grill is not onpart of the table which is located at the end of table  first time i see it setup like this for the booth that for four people only two will able to use the grill could be a quick way to convert to a bbq restaurant rather to replace the tables,positive
v17tgCRjuPQiFOq4uvEI-w,i love this place david and another blonde girl are so nice i told them it was my first time here and they were so helpful and patient even after i got my food he kept checking in to see if i was good and had any questions i got the stone bowl bibimbap and a ginger tea that was really unique,positive
HTgKfmmlzgE43trhntv8-w,very delicious overall with american sized huge portions i took one star off for the service it wasn't rude but it was pushy asked three times if we were ready to order within 510 minutes of sitting and was scattered no plates for kids hard to flag somebody down it was saturday night so definitely their busiest but probably need more staff,positive
A19aqMW-GfPd-8YXQJtbog,amazing happy hour  5 old fashion and manhattans we got the brussels sprouts amazing wings from the happy hour menu fall off the bone amazing we had 3 orders ripp fries probably my least favorite but still good definitely recommend will be back,positive
o8tFtgDhFO1kcBm3k652eA,this place can be easily overlooked it's a small restaurant partly hidden in maybe not the best area but i'm all about cheap eats and don't really care too much about appearances i just want tasty food and if it's a good price even betterchop chop shop has all sorts of asian fusion dishes we ordered the bowls which you pick a meat sauce and side on top of rice or noodles we were starving and the bowls were pretty filling i ordered the pork belly with a sweet and mildly spicy sauce shop sauce over rice with a side of mean greens my boyfriend ordered the chicken karage with purple slaw which was pretty decent too they also have unique burgers like one topped with pork belly and kimchi,positive
y5PBPekernnQkwwUuTzwSQ,the server is hot  my styledelicious food good mood great customer service my favorite kimchi soup i will come back for sure thank you for great service see you soon,positive

t1mWfxivNyGde5VxYYYhSA,my wife and i had eaten at the chinese buffet nextdoor several times but for some reason never thought to try here maybe because of the word cafe in their name maybe we thought out wasn't a real restaurant oh did i mention my wife is korean lol and we're addicted to korean food i can't wait to visit her family in korea just for the food just kidding honey anywayhighly recommend this place both for the authenticity and service the price can be a little high during dinner but ultimately it's worth it combine the personalized attention they remembered us by our second visit with the occasional bonus extras along with the quality and it's an overall valuei'm not sure why another reviewer said this isn't authentic we certainly think it is and as i've said we have spent a lot of time in korea both seoul and countrysidei would recommend going during lunch and strike up a quick conversation worth the server owner very willing to help and friendly good little find much better than the places down on pendleton pike by a long shotupdate after a couple years this still beats any other korean place we've found in naptown truly authentic enough to get through any bouts of homesickness,positive
rAytSQU5RQHvXe1Wl_j37w,food was deliciousbut on the pricey side as you have have to pay extra for the stone bowl and for kimchi which is included in the other korean restaurant i eat at,positive
FHNIvNgh3fS7VZQq2Y3dsA,all day everyday cheu delivers there's not much i can say about how great this place is definitely arrive right at 12pm for lunch or at 5pm for dinner or be prepared to wait it is definitely worth the wait menu is updated seasonally with fresh and unique options dumplings and tea updated daily garlic wings are fantastic ramen is extremely flavorful with thick noodz coconut curry is a personal favorite vegan options available and can sub meat for tofu cheu you are a go to favorite,positive
o1DuWXCV_kg_mSqNOxUdew,yes finally kbbq in reno this place is awesome great quality meat and nice service atmosphere is beautiful too it is really expensive though but i assume it's bc this is the first kbbq in reno,positive
rdiB9Aye9-gkwd2hnckWHQ,so many great things to say about this place i left here super satisfied and can't wait to come back in the near future i only wish this establishment was located closer to my home the service our waitress was very kind and attentive she fulfilled all our requests very quickly our food came out super quickly and super fresh i don't know what happens in the kitchen but they are well prepared and didn't keep us waiting the foodi can't say enough great things about the food every single food item i received was delicious i've been to a lot of sushi hibachi restaurants in the past but this is by far one of the best i was provided with a large amount of salad and miso soup the miso soup was delicious and full of flavor some places i've been the soup can taste quite watered down but not here the sushi rolls were down right delicious i've never had a peanut avocado roll but decided to give it a try and wasn't disappointed in the least there is a huge selection of sushi rolls available i am vegan and the others i was with are not there was something for everyone and each person in my party enjoyed their meal i am also very nervous about getting tofu in my hibachi i just feel sometimes the tofu is spongy or not well prepared however i took a risk and got the tofu here and i am so happy i did it was absolutely delectable i just can't say enough wonderful things about this establishment the food was by far some of the best i've hadthe atmospherethe restaurant was clean and orderly it was a nice relaxing atmosphere and overall pretty quiet it's a nice setting for a family or even a medium sized party we had 5 people in our party and were very comfortable the parking lot was quite busy and it was a little hard finding parking on a saturday evening there are many other restaurants nearby so the area tends to be busy on the weekends overallthis is a great establishment the food service and atmosphere are wonderful if you are looking for a great sushi hibachi place look no further this place has vegan options and they are very accommodating this place is truly a gem,positive
H7nagsl9oVcEaArJI4RIrQ,one of my favorite places to go to for korean food always quick and convenient get a great meal for less than 10 i often get the kimchi stew dol so bibimbap donkatsu  or cha cha noodles most dishes come with side dishes and sometimes even a broth soup order and pay at the cash register as soon as you get off the escalator they'll give you a number with your receipt and you just sit and wait until your number shows up on the board indicating your food is ready to be picked up it's like a cafeteria so remember to take your tray and empty dishware to the carts when you're finished,positive
d89jkOMbjpTBerh7miCz2w,i've been here 3 times already and each meal has been amazing i've tried their bibimbap kimbap possibly my fave item so far seafood pancake and jajangmyeon noodles i love the nofrills homey vibe they offer it really compliments their home cooked food the place is owned by a married couple so i'd like to take that as a sign of legitimacy lol check out their most recent menu below,positive
qc-xhHvmyzyrBAOZUeleig,ninja sushi is an awesome place where you can get amazing korean food and equally amazing japanese dishs and picture perfect sushi that taste as good as they look the wait staff is so friendly and helpful i had the spicy squid and vegetables the dish was superb,positive

CU75YM3XOAQ4lO12eWdlcA,so good whenever you need a korean bbq fix this place is definitely one of the best options i have never been disappointed the restaurant itself is a little bit older and the decor seems outdated but that almost adds to the charm of the restaurant the food is always fresh and very well done,positive
bn2jWrB_aXdQP4YoyUVVIQ,had dinner with my mister  last night for valentine's  day and every  things was amazingly  delicious  we will definitely be visiting  again  and that drunken  sangria  was everything,positive

nPfUxvE41sjRJqZTUj-qGw,amazing service person behind the counter was super kind and helpful i went with my mother and got a taiyaki 4 pack and they were so good the boba was on point too  would highly recommend coming here for a desert or fun,positive
1dLWCD6CjSHD7PTfi5ZVNQ,my wife and i ordered the seafood fried rice the lemongrass chicken and a soup from the vietnamese menuwe payed 35 dollars for our meal based on the pricing i assumed that we would get our money's worth but we didn't i literally had 3 shrimp 2 baby scallops and 3 pieces of imitation crab meat the soup only came with 3 thinly sliced pieces of white meat chicken that we payed an extra 150 for the lemongrass chicken was the only thing worth getting with a decent portion size would not recommend them for chinese food maybe their other menus are worth something,negative
di8vrP8Hpz9ueTdPg7s66A,favorless soup base and unfresh food you could barely taste the coconut in soup and the chicken is not good enough,negative
qsm7SkX60JsajT7Yz248FA,gross overrated overpriced all the food is mediocre at best i knew not to go there when i saw in pics of mostly nonkoreans will not go back,negative
1dLWCD6CjSHD7PTfi5ZVNQ,flavorless was the word spring rolls tasted like rice and not much else the bahn mi wasn't great stuffed chicken wing was ok but without the sauce it was bland crab puffs also needed sauce the basil chicken was above average and prevented the one star the bun bowl also was ok but not great,negative
oipTcwrQb6jQy0VrqpFumQ,i would give a negative score if i could 80 of time spent in there was waiting we have been waiting for 5 minutes to get seated 10 more minutes to get water served and order taken we had the ayce for two lettuce only gave us two pieces and when we asked for more the waitress said we can't give you until you finish all piece i mean there were only two thin pieces of lettuce wrap whole long do you expect us to finish them meat we could only order two at a time that's understandable but but but our table was like totally forgotten waited 20 minutes to have the waitress come back to our table to take the next round order the whole dining experience was sooooo negative that we couldn't even remember the taste of the food only the looooong looooong waiting the waitress also forget so many times of what we needed and we had to double the wait time  wait to take the order and wait to remind the waitress what we need this was a so stressful and regretful eating place will never go back,negative
7FAu3RT5V4baRyePoG-_xw,the new location is beautiful and well put togetherbutreally not the best place i've been to had the ayce and it seemed that every time i ordered something i was inconveniencing my sushi chef he was joking in spanish to his fellow chef and when i would ask for something they both looked at me like i was stupid and interrupting it felt weird and awkward the food was subpar and fish on the slightly warm side chef was holding it for a little too long while he finished his conversations being a server myself at one time and from a family who owned a restaurant for decades i am really a pretty tolerant person when it comes to service it takes a lot for me to leave a review that is not the besti am sure that other people have had different experiences but this was my experience,negative
Wkjt6DUTGX1zKpX0OnsvcQ,oh no no no no first how does a korean restaurant mess up the rice that's just inexplicable and unforgivable the white rice was mush we got the aged kimchi pork hot pot it was flavorful and tasty and big but what they call pork is actually uncooked bacon thrown into the hot potso as you can imagine you get very very little pork meat and lots of fat it is literally strips of bacon thrown into the hot pot broth definitely not what i anticipated and definitely not how i like to eat my bacon since we only tried one dish i would give it another try surebut i am not convinced that it would be worth itjudging by the way they make their riceon a lighter note the wait staff is very nice,negative
hEpRFnkUl4C6NVOVSMiTVg,first of all i was genuinely excited that there was a new korean restaurant in sb but this place did not meet any of my expectations and the food did not taste authentic i ordered a vegetable kimbap kimchi tteokbokki and chicken jjim and there was something off about all of those dishes the servers first start you off with side dishes which included kimchi bean sprouts a weird concoction of seaweed salad and spinach and bell peppers they weren't bad at all but i just wished there was a little more variety in choices the braised chicken with vegetables was not what it was supposed to be they served us a chicken soup with a bunch of vegetables and that's not what the dish is supposed to be like all the potatoes were not properly peeled and there was a zucchini stem in the soup that shouldn't have been in the soup also it was supposed to be a braised chicken not a soup this was a huge miss for me the vegetable kimbap was also off because there was something oddly perfumeysweet inside and it was very difficult to figure out what it was i must say it was visually appetizing unlike how it tasted the third thing i ordered was the most tolerable but still not the best the rice cakes in the dish were unevenly cooked some were way too overcooked to a point it turned mushy and some were undercooked the addition of kimchi also was alarming because the dish typically doesn't add kimchi and has a more bright red color from the gochujang that should've been added i am giving this place a 2 star because the servers were very nice and patient with me i will most likely not come back or if i do i'll make sure to try completely different dishes,negative
ZDdNEwBENLXBT3jjQD5STQ,granted i don't eat korean food often but if i do i know i won't be heading back to giwaof the six or so small tables two were reserved so we snagged some seats at the counter  while the seating fine the eating was not  i have had delicious bul gogi elsewhere but giwa's version looked like an odd bunch of veggies neatly arranged over some rice  not being in a salad mood i decided to go for the yook gae jang or the number 7 must be lucky right spicy beef soup the dish itself came with a big bowl of soup about three minuscule pieces of kimchee and about a dozen or so of those tasty beans as sides  the portion size of the sides was tiny or maybe i was hoping to get more of them seeing how my soup came out anyway number 7 was unlucky this time as it was spicy as hell salty a little sour and a lot inedible there are few times when i have ever ordered something i could not eat but this was one of them oddly enough my son thought it was decent enough so he ate his and part of mine my wife fared a little better with her galbi but it was only average in both of our opinions that being said the good thing about giwa is that it's conveniently located in the same block as dizengoff where i wound up eating instead or federal donuts,negative
_k1CIuPkY-uLFm8lABFG8Q,too salty in a 12piece boneless chicken wings we found 2 chunks of dough mv was great tho,negative
WDLwnD4FUOkKylMkj_FCXA,it was almost the only korean bbq around at the time so we drove about half an hour there but i have to say we were really disappointed  we were there on a saturday for lunch and they had a very small selection of meat and veggies  the taste itself was ok nothing special  but it was exceptionally expensive  they charged us around 35 per person  the lunch would be fine if it was around 15 but for 35 it really is not worth it  will not come again,negative
ZV8eIF820nOhsI-Tk0qt-g,these people have such terrible customer service and bad business ethicscame in with two adults and two children one sleeping on my lap and the other almost passed out at 945 pm on a sat was barely greeted left to sit and wait 20more minswe informed the waiter that the two kids have already eaten and are going to nap while we eat he said okay   then he comes back and informs us that they need to charge the two kids for just sitting there after explaining to him he leaves and comes back to tell us the owner is demanding he charges us for an additional adult and not two child rate if we didn't want to pay for the kids the waiter tells us he has no said  and understand our situation and wouldn't pay for it either after asking to speak to the owner and with consistent refusal to come out and meet and explain why we decided to leave shady unprofessional owners who hide behind their poor waiters who work their butts off to run tables only to have an owner make a stupid decision for money they have lost us for good we were a consistent every week group that came in to support their business think twice before coming in here as they will make a scene over nothingthis place makes korean people look really bad shame on you,negative
d9vapPUlJCSSrltRRKO9ig,i was traveling and i really wanted some good sushi after a whole week of a work trip this place has really good reviews on yelp so i decided to check it out boy was i disappointed the avocado had brown spots and the rice was way too mushy the overall quality of the fish was not great the only good thing i can say about this place is that is cheap and thank goodness it didn't give me food poisoning the day after i would not go here again,negative
_cndcbuaqSRW5f-MeZasNw,do not eat here they have roaches it was crawling on the table the manager only took the tax off he wanted me to leave a tip the only tip i can give them is call pest control we want be going back,negative
h-2kc8CGAbGdAxeXc_Xq8g,would not go there again the spicy pork is bland and they used wrong cut of meat the samgupsal was very thin once cooked which tells me that they use a poor quality of meat they have their baby and a son living out of the restaurant the service was lacking as they stop checking up on you after your food comes out avoid this place at all cost,negative
1nNYcxl_ItIZ61pO2ruNaA,i've tried other hot pot places or shabu shabu and this was my worst experience ever i got the spicy pot which was too oily and i bit into some peppers i think some dark round little balls and somethings came out of them that nommed my tongue and it wasn't only me it happened to my hubby and brother i'm thinking it was only our pot because everyone else seemed happy we left in the middle of our food because the feeling and the tasting of those little balls where nasty we had to run to cold stone to get ice cream i tried to forget our nightmare won't be coming back none of family would but if you do go i suggest you ask notto have those peppers added to your pot because they will ruin the whole thingi'm a shabu lover and this place doesn't look like a shabu station nowhere near to the places in california,negative
Oun4NN-u5yiHIxDqtJnxgA,re feliciaimplying that the customer should correct the issues of a business is absurd you should have known what you were getting yourself into and be well prepare before you opened your customers don't owe you anythingespecially not 50k or 15mil and being a smart ass when a customer does review is especially intuitive of your whole operation opening a restaurant is a risk because you have to cater to the publicyou've instead taken the risk out by trying to have the public cater to you which annoys people you don't have to have run a successful donut shop or be fred the baker to figure that outand i called you hipsters or at least the ones i saw hipsters because you fit the definition i'm sort of confused to why hipsters can't be working stiffs as well,negative
Cd6Dfli4JBpHGgh0LVslpQ,i recently had lunch at mama's house and had a really bad experience while the food was ok i felt  very disappointed in their practice of overcharging customer for side dishes without telling before ordering  after i finished the ones that were free with my order i asked the waiter if he could bring me just one more dish of kim chi a very small dish in fact he then brought it to my table without telling me that it would cost me extra in fact i only found out that he charged me 4  for it  when i asked it it was a mistake he simply said that's the exact cost i felt that even if it is not free he should tell me upfront that it would cost 4 and nowhere in the menu they mentioned that they would charge for extra side dishes i felt i was robbed and i will never be back,negative
9llupBLdHKFzfawIk6I74w,the place was clean but service was slow for the price you pay for food they should refill your water without you having to wait also when we requested more meat and rice the waitress forgot and had to ask again they use a portable cooking instead of the one that is incorporated on the table itself when you start cooking the smoke goes everywhere because there is no vent overhead to suck it up you come out smelling like the food you cooked i have been to many korean bbq and this is not what i would expect for the price i paid,negative
-psZLTe6IJTQUB-bZF7Zyg,got the very expensive bbq which is guarantee to be 50 because you have to get two type of meat but where was the lettuces can't call it korean bbq without lettuces side dishes were limited and portion size was ridiculously small had to repeatedly asked the server to keep bringing more side dishes ox tail stew was good but it was definitely not a stew,negative
ERwH8HwVXOsMc8OJdrN3nA,this place isn't good waker wings was way better korean fried chicken is typical doubled fried and seriously crispy with a little spicy kick and this isn't the sauce is nasty i legit almost puked when i tasted it i visit this market and food court all the time and have for years but i will not order from this chicken place not worth the money and you have to spend 15 to use your card and you can't order from the spot that you order all other food bring waker wings back even people that work there tried to tell me it wasn't good and the sauce was nasty but i had to try for myself before passing judgement and now that i have tried it i don't like it,negative
lFYTcfAbaab8jwJRkfjvmg,came here after i had the one in the city which i absolutely enjoyed hoped that it would be just as good but i was disappointedthe sauce was the same but the chicken quality was desperately low the wait time was also 50 minutes which i don't pardon considering the city's bbq chicken takes about 30 minutes for deliveryneedless to say i probably won't be coming back here but i will patron the one in the city i didn't rate this one lower because it is a chain,negative
IbndcMURguByburM72o3SA,i had visited this place before and liked ithowever there seems to be new chinese ownership going on and the food quality is very badi ordered a vegetable omelet and what i received was a compilation of canned goods no fresh peppers or mushrooms or anything,negative
yui1n1JawiW9g7RR62a_wA,how can a sushi restaurant mess up a california roll sushi was mushy and gross  kid's meal 10 fried rice 13 it was a big portion but still not 13 worth of rice the waitress constantly rushed usto order to finish to pay she just wanted us gone then she stood over us while we were calculating the tip not worth the money at all,negative
IHNKQZMZY8dmwsXKIvtz0g,driving through town on a crosscountry drive  used airbnb and found this place within walking distance  it's more bar than restaurant  we arrived on a sunday night at 740 pm and the bar tender came to our table to explain that the food area and bar are separate  we could not really tell no problem we ordered food from young man who was confused about the registered and ended up coming she to explain that he undercharged me got the 4 pork skewers  also ordered a pound of wings  my niece order philly cheesesteak and friesdespite ordering drinks too the bartender came back to explain that since food and drinks are separate that we had to pay separate  she then took our drink order  sound confusing  i was confused too  not a big deal since we were tired and hungry  food came out and looked like the pics the wings were bad  way over cooked  too bad because the sauce was promising too  the pork skewers were better my niece liked her sandwich and fries,negative
t1mWfxivNyGde5VxYYYhSA,really disappoint with this place  food is just ok but service is worse  came in at noon and sit for 15 minutes without any service after that wait more 30 minutes for food no water refill no anything  have many better korean food option in indy  not this one,negative
rVGxva6cx2eID4ghDLVHJg,i had a 830pm reservation here last weekend for 2 people we were running a couple minutes late so we called to let them know and they told us it wouldnt be a problem when we arrived the hostess told us they were running about 15 minutes behind so although we were a few minutes past our reservation time she said we would be seated by around 850 this restaurant has minimal seating in the entry so we had to stand next to the hostess stand and it was clear the list was very long and that we wouldn't be seated soon at 900 a guy came to the host stand from the bar and asked if his table was ready reminding the hostess that he had a 800 pm reservation so he had been waiting for an hour we waited another 15 minutes and at 915 when we still had two more parties in front of us we walked out staff was not impressive and continued to be misleading to people that came in after we did telling them that they would only wait 1520 minutes,negative
h2-mPUMYJ5pF_gVurDL3lw,probably no it's definitely the worse service i have ever have anywhere for sure  i came in for the bbq that cooks at the table i made it very clear to both the hostess and the waitress and double checked with them because they gave me a different menu than usual  we waited for 20 minutes and came our food that was already cooked  we were very nice about it because it was just a miscommunication and we were willing to wait even longer  however the waitress attitude toward us was very unprofessional and demeaning  i almost wanted to walk out of the restaurant  she basically yelled at us and she was going around to other table telling them about how we messed it up  she was saying it to a table right next to us loud and clear  for the table that was farther she was even pointing at us while telling the story  who does that it was horrible and if there was a zero star this would be it  i will never come back here  why didn't i complain to the manager well because this is a family business and from my past experience with them they don't seem to care about their customer either  an owner that don't care about its customer won't last long,negative
YQT53_5tc_sp3_Xp4c5Ehw,we have tried this place twice and both times the service was horrible the waitress took too long to bring out our food but we were patient after 25 minutes we asked if our rolls were coming out soon and she gave us a complex look she forgot to put them in and seems to be suspicious that we had actually eaten them and were lying to her up to the point that she started counting the half eaten rolls on the table asking each of us how many we had eaten and checking her booklet multiple times in the end she realized he had forgotten them and did not even apologize the second time around the service was even worse our rolls were brought out within 2025 minute gaps our group could not share our rolls because of their horrendously slow service in addition the waitress was annoyed every time we had to ask for drink refills the most annoying thing was when she was more concerned if we were paying together or separately as she sat us down the miso soup and edamame were served cold they took the edamame back and supposedly heat it up yet it was still cold or even more cold than before i would not recommend this place at all you're better off at sushi garden,negative
9dLo6wJFO06Ymj0cL2xPQw,i cannot think of anything witty to write about seoul q but i can say that i have deep hate in my heart for this place i would rather listen to iggy azalea sing elvis presley's greatest hits than revisit this seoulless bowel movement of an establishment the beef bulgogi seems to actively seek to insult the korean people the kalbi tastes like wet drywall the chicken bulgogi is a not a real korean dish and b reminiscent of baby food if not a baby's diaperour waitress was helen she was hostile  and terrible and brought our appetizers out late she lied about the closing time and about the dessert menu she tried to push us out of the restaurant i wanted to push the food off of the table if you'd like to have seoul q experience on a budget eat wet paint and get someone to poke you in the butt with a stick for an hour while playing the soundtrack to grey's anatomy,negative
e8rmWzn0xD34dslXQ3pj5w,extremely overpriced for portion size not offered any refills on any of the side dishes where i'm from this style of korean bbq is typically all you can eat for 2227 a person this one was 80 and not very much meat at all 2 up charge for more rice the amount of rice it comes with it about a cup not nearly enough for a family style meal only 3 pieces of lettuce for the lettuce wraps no refills on that either on top of it we had a very pushy waitress constantly trying to up sell us and never let us grill our own food unlike other tables i guess she assumed we couldn't or weren't doing it right because the utensils were taken right out of our hands when she came over we won't be back we'll stick to kfusion,negative
TR68yFRt9dn35zUKaI6lyw,my bf and i went to the korea garden restaurant at dekalb pike blue bell pa for dinner last weekend we arrived at around 9pm we were seated prompty and our orders taken shortly after that we started to enjoy our appetizerssoup and were looking forward to our entrees we noticed there were some flies though i was so unpleasantly shocked and disappointed with my 'spicy fried pork with vegetables' when it came it was a horrible experience the pieces of pork were served in great huge junks size of an egg of thick fat  skin that seemed to 'wobble' with very little lean meat the taste was ok but not spicy or delicious it was so hard to eat as i had to remove the fat before i could eat it and it was not easy to remove as the pork was so thick i had to give it up after struggling with it for 10 minutes we informed our waitress but she was not polite or courteous as she explained that was how the pork came and how they cooked it along with the fat without cutting it off incredible i had never known of any restaurants serving huge junks of fat she was so defensive and wasn't happy that i complained about the fat i wanted to order something else but she said the cook had left it was only 945pm we ordered some ice cream after that i suspected that she combined something slimy like mucus or something into my ice cream because i did taste something slimy at the bottom of the ice cream she might have spat her mucus into my ice cream  i will never go to that dreadful restaurant again  it was a terrible mistake,negative
LIRX83_KB4JeVVga2zGOxQ,the owner must have changed but the wings are not good quality anymore i don't mind paying for good wings but the wings got smaller the sauces changed they didn't have any rice or soup service was horrible and unprofessional used to do a lot of takeout here but i question its cleanliness and quality  waitress dropped off chicken and said it doesn't usually look like this but try it and let me know if it's ok very disappointing and way overpriced,negative
qY-BUQY-SFBaSrFHowF3nA,i go to many kbbq and this is one of the places i frequent most worst service i've experienced here or compared to other restaurants i waited about 30 minutes for our second round of food never got water forgot to bring pancake seafood seaweed salad kimchee and the extras waiters were rude never coming back again,negative
LIRX83_KB4JeVVga2zGOxQ,what can i say about sohothis is not the first time i've been there last fridaymy husband and i showed up and the parking lot is so dark we thought it wasn't open but it was we figured since the pope was in town we can grab a great mealpros we got 2 l orders of soy sauce and sweet chili wings they were delicious as always cons the server was off and seemed as if she did not know what she was doing she took my husband's drink without thinking walked away before taking my drink my husband also was not done ordering for appetizers and walked away we then ordered seafood pancake for appetizer and never got it although it was made and sitting on the counter for the server to bring to us management must not had been present because there was a family of four that came in that  wanted entrees with rice yet did not have any what asian restaurant does not have rice we were very surprised the server claimed that they wanted to prepare for their closing for the next 2 days not only that i had to use the bathroom and it was unisex there was a urinal which i don't care but oh my goodness could you not clean the bathroom in a year or two the place could use a reno if it wasn't for the wings we would not come here i'll be taking takeout from now on,negative

k5cwuKa2QxiLtTLVNxCwxQ,please do not go here the waitress was one of the worst waitresses i have ever had in my life she was rude my friend had hair and what looked to be a large glob of spit in her boba that is so disgusting who would do something that horrible to someone my friend was so upset we even still tipped her to be nice i am never going back there she had the nastiest attitude i truly hope they either fire her or close down the fried spring rolls were disgusting and almost looked burnt the rice noodles tasted like they came out of the box the only good thing about my meal was the boba and the regular spring rolls and after my friend found the hair and spit i threw my drink away the waitress even implied that we were poor and made fun of my friends for wanting a fork they eat with chopsticks all the time like what is her problem i hope they fire her,negative

eJDUZMLSwYT8QRKbZVTZKg,went there for dinner on a sunday night around 730 walked in and music was blasting from dj upstairs we were told music would stop in 10 mins nope continued to play for about a half hour and we could barely talk to each other food was eh wings super fried nachos were decent and edamame ravioli was prob the best of the bunch unfortunately i'll never go back people starting smoking cigarettes inside the restaurant and it seemed like everyone that worked there was ok with it had to complain to hostess and waitress the people stopped for a bit then continued to smoke so disgusting it's 2017 who smokes inside a restaurant wtf,negative
rAytSQU5RQHvXe1Wl_j37w,extremely disappointed that bab changed their menu at the south reno location and as a result they have now lost my business living in south reno bab was one of the few south locations that offered a healthy choice with their original bowls and i was thrilled when they opened their doors in the area i loved the regular nonfried chicken option as well as the tofu and i wanted them to do well so i brought my friends with me to dine and was a frequent customer all of their bowls were delicious and fresh i never cared for their fried chicken and i am extremely saddened by the decision to make this location solely into fried chicken also it is important to note that the bowl bases and options have also changed,negative
NXhblEG-3OTbOwBbyevIGw,we agree with other reviewers that service is not good and sometimes just rude   the food is average quality and small portions   there are better korean restaurants in reno and sparkswe are a korean family   at least we know what to expect,negative
hpfYTWeTkoX6dQEEfWowKQ,this is a korean mexican fusion style take out  i didn't try the taco or burritos  the bowl is considered good for 10  portion is decent but the spicy pork is regular pork with a few pieces of jalapeno peppers that to me is not spicy pork  also the special bibimbap is very expensive considered it is a take out  the authentic korean restaurants serve in a stone bowl is less than what they charged  the worst part is either they forgot or don't come with kochujang sauce  it's like spaghetti with meatball with no marinara sauce i am not sure will i go back,negative
kg8N1PNJM5cJmSkafUZ0Ug,the service and food are coming too slow appetizers came 45 mins after we sat down price is 30 more expensive than regular korean restaurants noodle was half raw,negative
-hto0uJjh8KFQZGc9ZAcuQ,tried it once  had the bibimbap and bulgogi beef  the price was right but both dishes were lacking in flavor  i've had much better korean food just not in st louis  service is good but slow as there is usually only one person working as the chef and waiter,negative
7PbJjm9Oeq9LqM9zKsF-8g,sorry to say i think they sold to someone elsethe place is dirty food seemed tired and old the rice had an odd smell and the prices went through the roofuse to go here off and on and the food was already fresh and top notchhad not been here in a couple years and now it's all different in a bad waythe old lady who use to cook and i think it was her hard working daughter are gonenot going backyuck,negative

d9vapPUlJCSSrltRRKO9ig,so just to help out as i would like to have a sushi option down the street my ginger salad looks like the pizza shop made it and the dressing is big glops of orange goo its pretty gross im not sure which is worse the salad or the luke warm california and spicy tuna rolls both covered in caviar can i get back my 12 bucks ,negative
qsm7SkX60JsajT7Yz248FA,i used to like eating here until the staff cheated my family this evening we ordered a large 20 piece soy chicken and three bubble teas only to receive 3 slushies and only 18 pieces of chicken when we called back about our takeout order the manager came on the phone and admitted they have been giving 18 pieces for 5 years even though their menu stated 20 piece then the manager offered 2 wings as if we were willing to drive back to the restaurant for 2 pieces of chicken,negative
2g3rvWWSD26WQEmK-iYj3A,service is very on and off depending on the waiter  one was great and another very curt and even brusque  if you get the moo shu ask for them to go very light on the salt  the chicken moo shu was so salty that i think i literally drank a gallon of water after  while i did like the ample portion of fried egg i could barely swallow it because of the saltiness  the pan fried angel hair rice noodles on the other hand were very bland and greasy  i think if you combine the two you get a happy medium  which is what i did do  the ma po tofu was solid but didn't really stand out too much  3 stars for the ambiance but the food and service are just meh,negative
6n1m1XaSqZcGsBUige13rA,2 people 1 menu  30 minute wait for service food on menu was pricey and hard to understand most not in english do not go here decore was awful service was hurendous if u have a party your going to make me wait,negative
9A1ve-8MfJcUcOGQYCLlKA,i found a dead fly in their pad ke mao dish  i sent an email to them regarding this and they haven't responded back  it's been over a month i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone as they are very sloppy,negative
raot7eGR74kljf3yI3qRCg,i really don't wanna give this review but it's the experience we had tonight perhaps the issue was we expected this to be a korean restaurant and therefore were disappointed started with the sushi which ended up being the best part of the meal then came the korean food the seafood pancake was not good at all it was undercooked and an awful texture it was under seasoned and underwhelming the hot stone bibimbap was not hot enough so my absolute fave part  the crunchy rice bits  were not there also don't expect banchan cause you get none my husband is from seoul and was super disappointed in the meal i'd recommend you go with sushi or any non korean dish if you eat here,negative
qY-BUQY-SFBaSrFHowF3nA,firat order they came fast and the second and third will take forever so i assume this is not a buffet there is a lot more korean bbq restaurants out there much better than this place better food and better service,negative
ZhAPdzBxhvvNInbhEPZ6jw,so i've been here twice and i'm not sure i would return for a third round  it seems i have to try the cheesesteak so perhaps i will  the udon noodles i had there were decent just standard and i was hungry  however i also got the korean bbq tacos and it was incredibly disappointing  the quality was not there and the beef was ground beef  not to mention i'm pretty sure i got sick from them after so not a success  i had korean bbq tacos at street food and they were infinitely better i'll give the cheesesteak a try and update my review then but for now i'd rather go elsewhere,negative
6dVaWHvm8YEw11eHgDH2eQ,i'm sorry the server and i didn't mesh i didn't understand why he was being difficult am sure i was to him didn't want the rice and noodles do mix regardless the food was disappointing i really wanted it to be good since i love korean food but it wasn't clear glass noodles were ok they are usually my fav anywhere got the marinated beef not ok and kimchi was so not amazing sorry again i don't like to give two stars but this was a bust i would have tried again if the food was more the ah,negative
iwXMgCxQD0CVFg1T7y4gng,we came here all the way from the dove mountain on the north side because they said there was good food we literally waited 10 minutes for someone to come out from the back i even walked to the back where the kitchen was and said hello there was a guy there doing something and he did not acknowledge me after waiting some more we were almost to our car when the attendant opened the front door and shouted after us if we needed anything at that point we already made up our mind to leave wish i could have tried the food now we will never know if it was good,negative
GNYNs8pu3J-GaSKLQueQSg,decided to get some pre marinated la kalbi short ribs the boxcontainer that the meat came in and leaking all over the place definitely could change to a different packaging just cooked some tonight and i had to throw the remainder out even though i just bought them yesterday the short ribs had an extremely sour expired taste i do not think the person marinating them knew what they were doing extremely disappointing and disgusting the grocery store itself also was cramped and difficult to move around in,negative
YQT53_5tc_sp3_Xp4c5Ehw,they used to be decent but seems to get worse with service price and overall food quality service is honestly one of the worst in town waiterswaitresses always seem inexperienced and slow they are never around if the prices of the menu are rising then at least try to serve quality food but no food does not taste great and they take forever to come out,negative
gtuoRlBPqoTIEPrcfbIP-g,this was a really hard review to write the thing is the food at this restaurant really is not very good the restaurant is tired and looks it my bulgoki was cold my rice was lukewarm my kimchi was watery and the fried mandoo and fried shrimp were clearly from a box the shrimp sauce was slightly modified ketchup so it's really not very good at allthe problem is of course that the people running it are very nice very friendly and make you feel at home so i guess it's the kind of restaurant you go into when you want a warm familiar place and you're willing to pay for what is at best very mediocre food,negative
u9modXzD6V2Gbpq0YS9W6Q,service was tolerable chicken in dishes was awful remainder was good if we come again we'll do carry out,negative
IHNKQZMZY8dmwsXKIvtz0g,i moved to south city a little over a year ago  stella blues being right down from my house seemed like a great place  i would drive down grab a drink use their wifi and eat some really good bar food  then it all went downhillthey changed their ownership and tried this new 'fast eddies' style concept  first off nobody can compete with fast eddies in alton that place is amazing  this place  cheap ripoff at best  we walked in wanted to grab a bit and maybe a drink  eh no  you must buy a drink before you can buy food  oh and only use cash because god forbid we use plastic  there was maybe 23 other people around one table and nobody else in this place  i walked up to the bar to order a drink and received no service  there was an asian couple behind the counter who completely ignored us as if we didn't belong  i tried saying excuse me but they ignored me  i will never go back and i would recommend anyone who wants a better atmosphere hit up any other bar on morganford,negative
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,this place is gross their miso soup is insant powder and i found hair in my sushi and the person working asked if i wanted them to remake me another one uhh hello why would i want that and have another hair in there don't think soi came here 3 times and never again i tried giving it another chance and it's just too disgusting,negative
rVGxva6cx2eID4ghDLVHJg,went here yesterday with my sister for center city sips because we had gone here multiple times in the last few years and have always loved it last night was nothing like their normal and we have gone during promotions like sips before the service was nice and the atmosphere is always beautiful but the food was awful the sushi tasted really off and we couldn't even finish it it even gave me food poisoning i am really sad to say that i will not be returning to the restaurant again after this severe case of food poisoning go at your own risk,negative
3QqkYkN4oIPCMWUG1B3LyA,i recently ordered takeout via telephone and found the sushi very disappointing the flavors of both of the rolls were bland and the raw tuna did not taste right once of the rolls was covered in spicy mayo which was a disgusting watery thin white sauce with absolutely no heat every other roll i've ordered with spicy mayo from other establishments comes topped with a delicious fairly thick orangecolored sauce that wakes up the taste buds i have no idea what happened with this restaurant's attempt on a sushi staple i threw out more than half of the order and would much rather have spent 20 on grocery store sushi than this abomination the sushi place just west of here on 96th is much betteri can't speak for the service as i had little interaction with staff they were pleasant but nothing above average for takeout service,negative
gtuoRlBPqoTIEPrcfbIP-g,very upset with the customer service at this restaurant i was starving came in and was not even acknowledged for a good 1520minutes being that their was seats available i understand if they were busy but i was there a long time no one else in line but me with personnel avoiding eye contact honestly i felt embarrassed and discriminated,negative
OoFCe8VbzzCr88SGC08omw,this is my first time writing a yelp review but this place was bad enough that i felt the need to make an account to share my experience this was probably one of the worst experiences i've ever had at a restaurant i was visiting philadelphia with some friends for the weekend and this was the only dinner place we went to and all of us were pretty disappointedservers don't walk around ever asking if we need anything and they barely came to our side of the restaurant so it was hard to flag them down for things it wasn't even busy at all we realized halfway through eating that some of us did not receive our side dishes with our meals after waiting to flag them down we asked if we could get our side dishes and the server just looked at us super confused and said well did you order any this restaurant has a pretty small menu so it blew my mind that the server couldn't just look at our food and realize that certain ones came with side dishes she just looked at us as if we were stupid for asking like we didn't read the menu ourselves and someone in our group did order the side dish platter which he did not receive either she said she'll look at our receipt to see if we needed any and then she came back eventually saying that yes we were supposed to get some side dishes and ingenuinely apologized servers would come around once in a while to refill our water but never ask us how is the food do you guys need anything else would you like a togo box do you want the check the staff was so awkward and quiet and didn't seem like they were trained at all on customer service my friend ordered the bibimbap with chicken but when we received his food he said i ordered chicken but this is beef and the server said oh we ran out of chicken first of all why couldn't you have told my friend that earlier instead of just serving him a different meat option why did you just assume he would be ok with beef what if he couldn't eat beef she didn't even say sorry for the mistake she just gave it to him and he just awkwardly accepted it so he could start eating because we had waited over 30 minutes for our foodthe food wasn't that great either they tried glamorizing the names of simple korean dishes to make it seem fancier than it actually is kimchi paella is just kimchi fried rice calling basic korean dishes a different name does not make it fusion or make it taste any betteroverall this restaurant needs to work on their staff and customer service i've never left a restaurant so upset for being treated so poorly by staff who clearly don't know how to say sorry it's your job to ask us if we need anything i don't know the names of the two girls that served us but i really hope they learn how to treat customers better as a koreanamerican it's pretty disappointing that this place has mediocre service and lackluster food,negative
TPEzPCl55UxttNQtCi328Q,late night poke craving took us to sakana express  now i had been to sakana non express plenty of times and always enjoyed our experience sadly the experience this evening was just meh  the fish quality was good and the bites were huge but with poke it is all about the sauces and they were not up to my families standards  where other places toss the fish in the sauce or put plenty on top they just use a little on the rice  and their spicy yum yum was neither spicy or yum yum presentation  4 quality of fish 5overall taste of bowl 2the saving factor of this trip is we also tried the korean style chicken while it wasn't exactly what i was expecting it was crispy and tasty we will not be back again for poke but maybe for the chicken  we will see,negative
tf6S06LD09IFDHUpOPqPaw,so bummed you guys are closed  drove an hour north to come eat here as the site said they were open until 7 pm pulled up at 430 and they were closed,negative
uaipZDBSvzDzUUlazpyGCg,i love supporting something new like minato noodles but the service tonight was utterly disappointing waiter is rather awkward and not polite waited 30 minutes for food to have them tell us that they're out of rice wait rice had to change order to ramen and wait another 15 minutesvery dissapointing i rather go to mommiji ramen for better noodles and service,negative
IHNKQZMZY8dmwsXKIvtz0g,i stopped in one night to grab some kebabs i had to pay 1 a drink charge and 2 a take out charge never again,negative
OXDo1mHlp2Io3CM6a1aB1w,the food tasted great however it made my partner very sick not 20 minutes after we left he ordered the burrito with spice pork maybe it was old or the pork was bad either way it made him very,negative
-6nqH2tdNHQdqb8LvILlBw,unbeliveable turn of events last night  we went to sushi yobi as we do about three times a month we spent our usual 100 on dinner the service was lacking which is not all that uncommon  we are firm believers in tipping commensurate with the level of service we receive  it is not uncommon for us to leave a 25 or 30  tip if service is great  on this trip we gave an 8 tip because like i said the service was bad  all was well until the server came over to our table threw down the check and told us quite rudely that there must be a mistake because we didn't tip enough and usually we tip more i have never had this happen in my life  needless to say we will never return to sushi yobi again  i can't believe the audacitycomplaining about a low tip when you offered sht service unbelievable,negative
t7lXDRAytv_pq5FLWSxtaQ,this place used to be one of my favorite asian super markets but lately things have really gone to hell  it's dirty with sticky floors unorganized merchandise in every isle and bugs circling around fruits and vegetables  yuck,negative
IFFuw9ZIzpcWSqu2OHmjZA,tampopo is japanese for dandelion which actually makes perfect sense since compared to any other respectable noodle joint in the city this place is a gaudy weedthe menu is incredibly bland unadventureous and uninteresting  i ordered the boldest thing on the menu i could find which was the tampopo spicy ramen  it was overcooked overspiced and definitely overpriced  you would think that the only dish named after the establishment would be a crowd pleaser  i mean they put their name on iti hope you like white rice because that's exactly the type of bland gaijin customers and staff you'll find here   eating sushi does not make you an honorary asian  the very least you could do is to learn how to use chopsticks instead of acting so indignant when you don't immediately receive a knife and fork with your meali can understand the appeal though  it's a safe choice to eat if you're a smug west philly yuppie looking for some trendy asian fusion cuisine  just don't ever call it an authentic cultural experience especially when it's barely edible,negative
7FAu3RT5V4baRyePoG-_xw,let me start by saying i have been here quite a few times the ramen is delicious so what comes next is worth enduring every now and then   their service   i have no idea what has been happening here my first 2 or 3 visits were awesome then it seems like there has been a lot of turnover and the service has suffered greatly   tonight i asked for spicy level 1 black garlic came out no spiciness whatsoever it typically has some kind of bite my wife ordered the same and just like mine not spicy she asked for some chili oil server said okay 10 minutes later no dice   we had to ask again and the place isn't even busy maybe 5 tables seated since our favorite server left 8 months ago the others have only asked to fill my drink once any other time i have had to ask they have forgotten orders brought out wrong orders and basically ignore you once your food is served we have also come with friends and upon being seated stated we wanted separate checks and this reaffirmed when the food was served that we wanted separate checks the checks came out all combined   we told them how to split it up they did it wrong so it came down to talking like they were 5 in order to get right  in short great ramen my favorite around but their service is quite subpar i haven't felt like leaving a penny tip yet but they have not earned me giving more than 15 and i kinda have a hard time giving them that much  ,negative
tLgw_VI8yIgiJJ9-1VcL0g,hubby and i decided to randomly try this place since we were walking by looking for somewhere new to eat  i ordered the chicken hot stone pot and my husband ordered the seafood hot stone pot despite the fact that our dishes were a bit bland and dry thankfully the food still tasted good i have seafood in quotes is because he got in his seafood dish two baby shrimp two nickel size rings of calamari and one measly mussel the rest of it was mostly rice onions and a few veggies 1299 my chicken dish was in the same boat as his a little chicken with lots of rice and some veggies 1299 the portions were disappointingly small and expensive for what you get  the only one server was polite but did not bother to suggest something to order especially since we were first time in the restaurant and unfamiliar with the cuisine  we had to pry it out of him and ended up ordering the hot pots he did not come back to ask how it was there was another person behind the counter who seemed to be the owner who also did not bother coming over to ask how everything was or if we needed anything else after dropping 32 plus tip for two snacksize entrees we left the restaurant feeling jipped  we will not be going back,negative
HIAJ2mnlm_pP38_8GbgQ5g,store is clean not a fan of their marinated meats anymore as they as way too salty and all taste the same also not a fan of the small restaurant inside i got really sick after eating there,negative
7PbJjm9Oeq9LqM9zKsF-8g,went there for lunch today there were two other folks eating in the place the waitress didnt say hardly anything i told her i wanted the bi bim pap it came in a reasonable amount of time but it was tastelessafter living in korea for four years im quite familiar with good korean food even the rice had no flavor the side dishes were sparse but tasted ok finished up and went to pay and left wont be back here,negative
itv5mVA2lkp_ivhSdmKGgw,i for some reason went in thinking that there was an ayce option since they had the grills on the tables i was wrong the amount you have to actually order is a lot if you want to use the gril so my girlfriend and i didn't have that option it would be great if you had a big party the side dishes were ok nothing out of the ordinary or impressive we ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and soondubu the bulgogi was a little salty which is kind of normal for a lot of kbbq places the bibimbap didn't come with the red sauce that is usually smothered on top i don't know if this was a mistake that night or if they don't have it at all in their dish but we found it odd the soondubu was bland but had a hefty amount of tofu in it the service was exceptional though another weird thing is that we sat near the sushi bar so it smelled like sushi all night definitely not used to that in a kbbq place all in all a very ok place to go to if you want to fill a kbbq craving without being impressed and want to pay a lot of money,negative
7PbJjm9Oeq9LqM9zKsF-8g,extremely slow service there were only 3 people doing all the work for a place that had about 10 tables at dinner time on a weekend they should at least anticipate the crowd plus when the food finally came it was not at all spectacular i've had better,negative
-wlmZ-b35UJ-GY-59NDxyw,this review is for the catering departmenti called to order food for a pot luck the woman who claims to be the manager of the prepared korean food department was extremely rude she didn't want to be bothered with my questions about the size and price who conducts business like that of course i'm interested in how much i'm getting for the pricei couldn't talk to the woman anymore so i asked to be transferred to the main number she hung up i called back to complain and the worker on the phone was aware of her ill temperament well h mart you just lost a customer,negative

WBSxYvhLvXWY4jKcRDSfiw,this is an adequate sushi restaurant it will not necessarily satisfy a craving for wellprepared sushi but if you're hungry for something that isn't american or italian as you leave the beach i guess this place will do the miso soup was overly salted and had literally two tiny cubes of tofu in the bowl it was 97 broth with little else i ordered a dragon roll which was presented in two rows on a small platter the eel was not badly cooked but i found the eel sauce slathered over it to be too salty making it difficult to taste the meat also the sushi rolls here had the tiniest sliver of avocado i've ever seen so that you could not taste it at all the rolls were heavy on rice and cucumber slices and very much lacking in any other substantive ingredients i also ordered jasmine tea which tasted extremely bitter as though it had been steeped far too long no amount of sugar could overpower the tannins in that teapot very disappointing the biggest grievance i had with this restaurant is the terrible customer service when we arrived at the restaurant we asked to be seated outside and were told all the tables were occupied a few minutes later a group of three women came in and also asked for an outdoor table and were also told it was occupied they were seated indoors next to us however a minute or two later we all noticed the people at the outside table were standing up to leave and the three women asked again to be seated outside we also asked again our waiter agreed to let the three women sit thereeven though we had arrived earlier and expressed interest in the table earlier because they asked again right before we did he was generally extremely awkward and appeared to realize his mistake right after it happened,negative
V83KkmOgTx_h1LDA_A1kow,you asked if i wanted rice with my soup i said no you asked if i was sure i said yes you tried telling me it's really good with rice i told you i was fine and i meant it no mystery or suspense about it whatsoeverso then what do you decide to you you take a bowl of rice and you brazenly dump it into my soup for me you seriously just did your own thing with my food after i said i don't want any can you even wrap your head around how obnoxious and assholish that is i don't know if that's customary in your culture and i don't need somebody who's been there to look for an opportunity to travel brag and chime in because i don't care but it's really really rudeyour portions are also ridiculously tiny for an exorbitant amount of moneyfuck this place,negative
fp7IHO1z53wYP4PzKSl11g,i would give this place negative five star if i could the food is not edible ordered kimchi pho it is off the chart salty and the bowl was dirty i am from la and maybe i am expecting too much in a small town but this place does not deserve all the good reviews seriously 4stars,negative

knp4GbMlIQZAppyEVnUkQg,the quality of the food is ok it is way overpriced and the portions are too small,negative
Cd6Dfli4JBpHGgh0LVslpQ,this place was recommended to me by a local korean so i was very excited to try it sadly i was disappointed in every way look it was dingy with 1970's furniture and decor sound when i go to a foreign restaurant i want the experience of that culture the music was american rappop music that did not fit the setting price when i saw that the fried rice was 14 i knew it was a sham i am from chicago where food is typically more expensive but i have never seen a 14 fried rice taste i got a pork and rice noodle broth bowl which was very bland just no flavor my wife got a noodle dish which was also bland we love food from all over the world and are very adventurous eaters so we are not moonlighters to korean food maybe i'm spoiled from chicago korean but i was very disappointed by every aspect of my experience here,negative
6n1m1XaSqZcGsBUige13rA,worst meal of my life  inedible due to excessive spiciness  my seafood dish contained 2 shrimp  i've never regretted a restaurant choice more than that evening st rice,negative
rVGxva6cx2eID4ghDLVHJg,meh they used to be better years ago it's not like i got sick or anything but the sushi is just mediocre the service is pretty good though but who goes to a sushi bar for good service,negative
-psZLTe6IJTQUB-bZF7Zyg,arrived at 830p and all the tables with a grill were covered we were offered the option to get a regular table and just order without grilling i proffered to get started at a regular table then we'd move to a grill once any party left i was told okay but we close at 930pm disappointing night all around i asked others do you want to leave or stay we left apparently dining on a sunday night in new orleans is a crap shoot of who'll be open and for how long,negative
PICgL-_LU1GPRZdBn-DrWQ,just so happen to drive by and saw this place had just opened wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised it's an asian fusion restaurant you pick your base veggies meat and sauce they have a lot of options i decided to go with the noodles a few veggies spicy chicken and all of the sauces on the side of course the food was delicious and not bad for the price here's what i had an issue with i've never paid in cash at and dining establishment and had the cashier check if my cash was real or not i was so shocked i watched as he checked out other customers and didn't bat an eye when they paid in cash i will not come here just because of that unfortunate experience,negative
tNnVxOC_9p8UK3N_2-yCtQ,horrible food great service our family use to go here all the time until they changed the ribeye meat used for the bulgogi now it tastes exactly like a cheesteak no exaggeration,negative

cBp1fn2LXpSHe4VbTXLYEw,i used to love bab before tonight i had eaten my bowl of food and got down to the bottom of my cup of miso soup and there was a hair i got up and bought it up to the cashiers and the girl with black hair said oh i asked if there was a manager on staff that i could talk to keep in mind this was 7pm on a saturday night 10618 she spoke to me like i was crazy for wanting to speak to a manager and then she said i can give you a free bab i think there's a miscommunication in today's society when someone asks to speak to a manager it is assumed they want free stuff the reality for many of us likely you included if your reading reviews on a place is that you want the issue fixed the same is true of this review because in reality i'm hoping that bab will fix the issue rather than brush it off this was on my list of places i used to recommend to friends looking for a cute date night or a good place to eat before going to the movies it embarrasses me that it is possible that friends i have sent there could have experienced this after i sent them there the kitchen staff needs to be required to wear hair nets rather than just a ball cap it is clear that the ball cap wasn't enough,negative
rwDq9kqpKvs01wLbOTHzKw,oct 2014 kinda disappointing lately  tian fu chicken was always my favorite dish but too few veggies and too much old tasting chicken  servers are still friendly and helpful  i liked the previous decor  oh welloct 2015  read other reviews  diners should check marion co food inspection reports on this and other mc places  tian fu was dinged in june for many cleanliness improper issues etc which probably relates to my 'old chicken' and other comments about getting sick  here's the link to the food inspection report  httphhcwebfoodhhcorporgreportsinspectionreportaspxlicensenumber204382establishmenttian20fu20asian20bistro,negative
I2ISRV7IybkMc3HEYKUE9g,pretty awesome experience  we went there with a local who loves it there  it was evidently 'restaurant week' in philly while we were there so not sure what the menu is typically like  for this particular week it was a prix fixe menu i think there were 5 appetizer selections and 5 or 6 entrees appetizers  grilled shrimp were incredible  perfectly cooked savory sauce to spice them up little  fresh pear and gorgonzola flatbread with sunflower seeds was wonderful bread was light a great combination of flavors and textures  i confess i can't remember the 3rd but it was good entrees  i had the pork chop which was a generous double chop roasted to perfection  topped with a light complimentary sauce sautéed asparagus on the side  portabella mushroom pasta dish was lovely plenty of mushrooms on a bed of wide flat noodles buttery sauce  seared ahi tuna was perfectly done also a light breading nice and hot on the outside cool and wonderful inside desserts  evidently as part of the prix fixe menu the restaurant decides what to serve you for dessert  we got a 'lava' cake wonderfully chocolaty and dense superb cinnamon rice pudding and a fabulous creme brûlée  above and beyond delicious  we actually got a 4th dessert  a small portion of a light cleansing something with some fresh blackberries service was good attentive and friendly again not being a philadelphiaite i was surprised that a restaurant of this caliber doesn't really have a bar or wine listit's byob  also it's cash only which is fairly prominent on the information for the restaurant but i didn't pick it out and was unaware of the policy until i pulled out my credit card we sat outside the weather was perfect for it  the inside seemed a little cramped and definitely loud overall a great accomplishment my hat's off to audrey claire and my fork is ready to return,positive
3gXgILE2YWVidJDvVWBT6Q,i love this restaurant it's usually very busy which is great for this place the food is always so wonderful and the wait staff is always very obliging my fiancè loves the taylor pork roll sandwiches sometimes they offer specials like potatoe pancakes which are phenomenal basically everything is amazing,positive
U158K3VPSN8ZFlJ1rlR4FA,love this restaurant the food is fantastic if not getting just pizza i do think it's a bit pricey 60 for two entrees and hummus before tip however the service is good and the food is good so i'm good with the prices cannot wait until they complete he expansion,positive
LGYIhGqbYakMMdsn_GCzJg,holy crap the pasta is good here i got the pesto chicken and it was some of the best i've ever had  what a lot of people don't realize is that not all restaurants on the hill serve fresh pasta there's a big difference  other things were good as well such as toasted ravs etc  finally found a place that serves fresh pasta without breaking the bank,positive

SGPYov8J5Yl-UTo8Yogl1w,to start off amazing ambiance while the crowd felt a little more upscale the overall experience was very nice the hummus and bread was amazing i got the steak which was good although not as flavorful as i would have hoped the service was a little slow towards the end of the night but this was to be elected as there were not many on staff by the end all in all a great experience would definitely recommend,positive
fKDV_dlDhXd7P5kZi97Kng,i order from here using grubhub a lot delivery is always super speedy about 30 mins tops and the food is always hot my go to is the pepperoni calzone it's enormous and the crust to cheese ratio is spot on also if you're not a ricotta fan then you're in luck since there isn't a ton in short  good reliable delivery food for nights you don't want to cook but don't want to spend a lot of money,positive

xhtmIQ-NgT86Qzw7L6xhLw,first visit and it was great  i had the shrimp kabob salad and fruit  all was great healthy fresh fast food alternative as mentioned in other reviews the fast part is a bit lacking but the food is worth the little extra wait,positive
6rOZ16N6YlpLC9_7fDnMLw,it's just plain good  greek food is one of my favorites  it's literally the food of the gods  lol  everything tastes so fresh and healthy  zoes is no exception  my shrimp kabobs were phenomenal  i'm not sure what exactly i was expecting based on others reviews but wow  they were perfectly cooked and they were fresh  if these suckers had ever been frozen i would be shocked  they were so good i was turning my head so no one would see me suck the shells  don't judge me i lived in new orleans  the grilled zucchini was nice and charred and spicy which i was not expecting but i don't mind a lil kick being from the south so i enjoyed that  but if you don't like spicy food watch out for that  i was not expecting it at all  lol  the cucumber sauce was divine  it complimented the shrimp beautifully and really just accented the whole dish  and really helped to cool down those zucchini  the side greek salad was perfect  loved the extra bottles of dressing but especially loved the pepper grinders on the tables  wish all restaurants did this  i love fresh cracked pepper on everything  lol  but honestly nothing needed to be seasoned and didn't need any extra dressing  the pesto hummus was incredible  my husband will not touch hummus  baby vomit he says  i've never seen him eat it since i've known him  but he loves pesto  tada  convert  yay  now i can finally get him to try other types of hummus and i can finally order hummus again  oh how i have missed hummus  the pita was so soft and warm like little pillows to scoop up copious amounts of hummus  i just wish they had given more pita  i was happy to get extra pita with the entree  i used that to eat the leftover hummus  not a chance in the world that was getting left behind  i'm sure my husbands meal was good too  it was the mediterranean chicken  he said it was good and he ate every last bite of it  i did try the white beans which were very tasty  i love white beans  i love pretty much all beans  again its a southern thing  lol  but i was so involved in my shrimp kabobs that aliens could have invaded outside and i would have never even noticed  we will be back  a lot  i'll update my review and if they stay consistent will definitely be adding a star  ,positive
Q6K5tpwqOzeewDw5ePlqbw,holeinthewall is right this place is right across from opal sands resort so i thought this would be a great place to walk over to for lunch i was a little worried because the building looks old and ran down walking in i was nervous because the inside didn't look much better than the outside and it smelled not so good i was almost ready to leave  with some doubt we continued to stay and order and i am so glad we did this pizza was awesome i even ate it the next morning cold and it was still good compared to other restaurants in the area i got a great meal for a great price,positive
ISDVzdF4WZ4SXQdhyet9nQ,this is our default restaurant when all else fails when we cannot figure out where we want to eat we go here it's affordable tasty friendly efficient warm cozydid i say tasty yesthis place has very good greek and american food  we love the servers the cooks the salad makers the hosts and gushe manages the place and cooks too it's a really welcoming place to eat and chill go,positive
lcKgQdQU1D38ahpFDE1hUg,nicesized portions and great value  features greekmediterranean and italian cuisine  i've ordered the chicken marsala tastes similar to olive garden's but better imo and the baked spaghetti  they also do delivery within 3 mile radius i believe,positive
DrA9rCWBzm4CSZFZCzDhHg,good food comfortable atmospherei have been coming here for years but i often ordered gyros hummus falafel etc   broke out of my mold the other day and tried the lamb shank  it's like getting hte feeling when one finally breaks down and gets a microwave or a smart phone  how the heck did i get along before without fronimo's lamb shank as part of my greek food selection  the meat must have been marinaded and cooked in all the spices and herbs for months before it was served  i eat a lot of rice with my daily meals but the side of rice served with fronimo's lamb shank was such a perfect companion to the meatbesides the excellent food what i like about this place is its unpretentiousness  you simply order at the counter sit down and they'll bring your order to you  if you thought athen's or my big fat greek rest are the only places to get greek food you have been missing outlast but certainly not least they make their baklavas right there on premise,positive
fN17POyxijqDNBBe2UGZkA,wonderful food with great service quaint style but has a true sense of the mediterranean,positive
DQnKn3e_PCa1E0OPcxVsBA,the whole fish and octopus are amazing also the falafel is the best i've ever had please don't tell my mom try it you won't be disappointed,positive
yJbjrrphcm_gek_dM7p1OA,my wife is part greek and i spent a lot of time in greece which means we can be pretty picky saw some good reviews and since we live close we had to try it ordered a gyro and something that wasn't on the menu but we both love which is a traditional moussaka the gyro was amazing finally a place that gives you plenty of meat and good meat insert 5 jokes here it was very flavorful one of the best gyro's i've had the moussaka was also very good posted photo though lacked a bit of seasoning making it a little blend just being very picky here but it was awesome i appreciated that they put the tomato sauce on the side if there is any downside is due to the rice it was strangely spicy why rice should not be spicy a small issue in an otherwise really good experience will be back for sure please thumb up my review if it was helpful to you,positive
m0bREye3nKAWWItFxQkTdQ,i'm upping from 3 to 4 stars  it has been a while since i came here and i've never been for lunch so we decided to head backon the specials for the day was lemon chicken soup  it's similar to the lemon chicken orzo soup at sweet tomatoes if you've ever had that except for that it's a greek recipe and here you're getting it from a traditional greek restaurant  as the server said when he delivered it soooooo good  we received a large bowl with a large wedge of fresh lemon for added lemon taste which i would recommend using  it had a little kick of what seemed like white pepper which was enough to give me a little sniffle but not too much considering my pretty weak threshhold for spicyhot  so i had to ask how often it was among the specials so i could come back and get it again and he said they offer it every 2 or 3 days until they run out  i'm making a note of thatthen we followed it with the lunch gyro  it's about 595 for your standard pita with lamb tomato onion and tzatziki sauce greek yogurtsour cream for an additional 2 you could have the deluxe which is the same but adds feta cheese and lettuce  i don't think the deluxe is necessary  the gyro came packed with toppings and you would have to pickeat a few items off to start if you wanted to fold itor they provide you a steak knife so you can leave it flat and knife  fork itthe gyro doesn't come with anything additional but with the soup it was filling and came to 1149 with water to drinkif you want to share an appetizer i would highly recommend the hummus with pita  it is the best hummus i have ever had anywhere so far but this will run another 750 or so  i would recommend purchasing extra pita to go with this because you usually run out of pita before you run out of hummus,positive
rBE5TT_ndOOczNBrbRnJwA,food is excellent but beware of the extra pita scam that sht is not free eat your extra dip with a spoon lol,positive
LGYIhGqbYakMMdsn_GCzJg,every time i come to st louis to visit i make sure to stop by anthonino's wonderful fresh pastas and the best cannoli i've had anywhere it's a little pricey but worth the expense i wish i were there now,positive
oQ_SoB3-57wqGETW_K6AtQ,we live close to norma's and have dined here many times it's a great little byob with an authentic middle eastern menu it's a very casual place with friendly service i always get the israeli salad which is fantastic cucumbers peppers and tomatoes with their special lemon and herb dressing i also like their lentil soup very much i also enjoy the vegetarian combo and my husband is a big fan of the kabab mixed grill if you need extra entertainment they have a great belly dancer on saturday nights too,positive
ruE_DRE6fTIE6who59hdfQ,my friend  i stopped by before our pedicures for some appetizers i loved the white sangria and fried stuffed mushrooms absolutely delicious nice location and decor,positive
I2ISRV7IybkMc3HEYKUE9g,we need more restaurants in nyc that support local farmers  byo  had the pear and gorgonzola flat bread mussels and brussels sprouts to share for dinner of 2  plenty of food  outdoor seating was great popped open a bottle of white and service was friendly with a smile and with suggestions,positive
TV81bpCQ6p6o4Hau5hk-zw,we devoured the desserts too quickly in the restaurant to get pics which speaks to their deliciousness hubs had the almond pasta greek for pastry kind of like a cake and i had the kataiffi like baklava in shredded wheat form  honey walnuts and shredded phyllo dough the bakery itself has loads and loads of pastries and other desserts to choose from along with ice cream and coffees we bought a huge wheel of a sweet almond bread to take back to family those hosting us on our trip down here huge like 13 or 14 inches in diameter and very reasonably priced 12 it was so delicious it didn't last more than a daywill definitely come back when we're in tarpon springs again,positive
I1h0GRYp86eX-XqwVXsSGA,i had their fish sandwich falafel shawarma gyro at different visits at both tampa and st pete locations delicious food efficient service very well taken care of,positive
Eto7duDaxGiOvtakWiGEqg,super good food the gyro meat is seasoned perfectly and i love their tzaziki i do wish the gyros had cumbers and a bit more tomatoes on them but overall super delicious and will definitely be back,positive
8JEOmVGQffkr6xtn4vvplQ,the fries were really good homecut can't be beat i had the falafel sandwich the falafel itself was flavorful,positive
tixiynQF8-KztXQLpyctJA,we've been to ari's twice and we love itif you can eat outside do it  the plants around the patio are beautiful and make for a nice setting  on this past visit we were inside out of the rain  each time i have ordered the greek platter moussaka pastitsio and dolmathes  along with 2 sides  always great  i had their greek soup that is on the menu can't remember the name  sorry as one of my sides and it was great  the greek potatoes aren't bad but aren't my favoritemy husband gets the gyro plate and loves them  my kids have ordered things like a bacon cheeseburger loved it toasted ravioli dolmathes and gyros  they are always happy with what they get as well  my husband asked about beer on this visit and decided to try the greek beer they carryit was yummy,positive
AUWysAFFrbK6F7MCbmamQA,really enjoyed my meal the falafel salad was great and tasted fresh the customer service was top notch and everyone was very helpful and nice the restaurant was also very clean and comfortable ,positive
ksVNbLJtHk7OXvpG-j_N-g,i've been searching for a middle eastern place as good as this for a long time  my friend took me here and from the looks of the place on the outside i wasn't expecting much  it is very unassuming  not really a restaurant in its own right its more of a place where you come and take your food away to sit outside on a sunny day  the owermanager was so sweet and seemed so happy to see us  he gave us suggestions of what was good that day and we both got falafel and tabbouleh  two of my favorite dishes made perfectly and at a good price,positive
yK2F2XBum1UdJz3o24mK2w,excellent gyro friendly family i've only had a lamb gyro and chicken gyro plus the potato chips  fries are great,positive
EmSd4cSZgJs7D2AXsHIxBQ,great fast greek food  we've been in twice and the owner has been there both times  today he actually served our drinks chatted with our daughter and cleared our table  it's always great to see that kind of commitment to make the place great  the greek salad is wonderful and so is the spinach pie  we really like the gyro as well  the pita bread is a little soft but it's packed full of meat and it has the right amount of sauce  the chocolate mousse cake is amazing  the chicken souvlaki portions are small but still tasty  will definitely be back,positive
04UD14gamNjLY0IDYVhHJg,two words grilled octopus'nuff said and try to get sammy as your waiter 'cause he's the best,positive
Sd8NrlgB6SY6GEtIjPupfA,my favorite fast foodin nashville for a little over 5 you can get a huge falafel sandwich drink and side of rice or seasoned fries that's well usually enough for 2 meals for medid i mention the service after just 2 or 3 visits the employees all recognize me and sometimes they even throw in a few extra falafels delicious food for the same price you would pay at the burger king next door and you're also supporting a local business,positive
Rz-tyulofvEnNeyQwFZw_w,if you find yourself out in brandon at lunch and are looking for some amazing greek food swing into truly greek  the place is located in a big strip mall but don't let that deter you this place is legiti was in a hurry so i ordered the lamb  beef gyro and made it a lunch combo the combo adds your choice of side and a drink i got the greek salad as my side and it was so good  the veggies were fresh and crisp lots of feta and the dressing was todiefor the gyro was super flavorful and it was obvious the tzatziki sauce was homemade  huge portions as wellbased on the crowded seating area for lunch this is a popular place for locals stop byyou'll thank me later,positive

8xUO86TcmguXWWDJZTDjTw,first time we tried greek city cafe but was looking forward based on the reviews today we did take outmy guy ordered his goto gyro and loved it the gyro meat was tasty but not salty the vegetables were fresh and plentiful as was the meat french fries were good even when reheated in the skilletmy greek salad looked wonderful with iceberg and spring greens as well as  chickpeas chopped tomatoes red onion feta cheese and the florida greek salad staple potato salad sadly the lettuce was past it's prime wilted and soggy the dressing  was watery and tasteless i'm certain if it was fresh it would have been delicious too i took two pictures of the salad the one in the bowl is shown with anchovies from home the second in the togo box after i had plated my salad if only it had been fresh this review would be five stars the pita and tzatziki were good toothe four star rating is based on the type of establishment where you order your food at the counter the four stars are warranted based on other places with the same concept,positive
8V9G6dC9sLCGp1LQVrmXwA,the portions are not particularly large for the price but the food was awesome pretty friendly service and nice ambience the booth seats were a little ratty looking but it didn't bother me i don't usually like mediterranean food but this place won me over everything we ordered was cooked perfectly,positive
H8Jp8WidE99di2Xapgbe-A,it's a classic mom 'n pop store but i think it's only mom tiny and unimpressive on first sight  looks like it's more for takeout  but don't be fooledthe staff is amazingly wonderful and professional and the food is wicked good  we had breakfast items like yummy french toast and lunch items like the spanakopita served round and it was so nice and gyros which were mild tasty and so freshkleo was behind the counter the quaint place has such a nice atmosphere to it  this place is tops,positive

8l1VfyDv9yxDca7INFBKuw,very good gyros were amazing hummus had good flavor as well with some tasty fresh pita bread i would come back again,positive
adb1hOYICrJ1Ix8M0sRpbw,we had an early dinner so i can't rate the ambience since we were the only people there however it looks like they have a busy delivery service the place was clean the service was attentive and fast we ordered the fried calamari two souvlaki platters one lamb one chicken they are fairly priced 1114 a platter came with greek salad tzaziki sauce pita and 3 skewers of choice of protein pita tasted fresh meat was marinated and seasoned really well only thing was the platter came with french fries not something i expect to see at an authentic greek place i would have preferred rice but my one year old prefers fries over anything else so it worked out we will be back to try other things on the menu,positive
CuyQt_cUFS1i738GXTNciw,we were pleasantly surprised with effie's  it was a second choice for the night because our first choice was too busy but i am glad we ended up at effie's  we sat outside in the back garden area which was super cute  our food was great and of course byo makes it awesome too  the only thing was that we ended up having a ton of leftovers after our waitress pushed us to order more food since she thought we didn't order enough  that wasn't a huge issue though  overall we had a great experience and i would definitely go backthis is one of philly's higgen gems,positive

4-PWLvDweauT1927XUOW5Q,i've been to athens on 4th ave many times over the years in my opinion it's the place to get greek food in tucson it's authentic delicious and staffed by friendly servers if there's one thing i feel is nonnegotiable when it comes to eating at athens it's the tiri saganaki saganaki is kefalotiri cheese that's set on fire with the help of some alcohol then served with lemon and pita the cheese is firm so the fire crisps the outside and softens the inside but it doesn't become melted or unmanageable the citrussalty double punch is mouthwatering seriously my mouth is watering just thinking about it and a great way to whet your appetite for the meal to come i also like the tzatziki and domalthes appetizers as well as the horiatiki salad the village salad tomato cucumber onion feta and olives tossed with olive oil and seasoning  no lettuce my favorite three entrees are the garithes pasalimani sauteed prawns with garlic herbs and cheese the kalamarakia lightly fried calamari and the seafood platter santorini mixed shellfish and fish over pasta in a white wine sauce the first two are served with your choice of rice or potatoes i recommend the potatoes the latter is a seriously hefty plate of pasta and seafood and you can almost certainly count on having a second leftover meal of it it reheats well thankfully athens on 4th ave is a bit pricier than the other greek restaurants around town so i usually keep it as a specialoccasion type of place the price difference is worth it though,positive
f4DCA9U-TigfarQSagXkLA,the menu is varied and all looks good the rice bowl is was wonderful  and i like the lentil soup the best,positive

17Y8circEnkMMXKfLo8Ztg,i found bitar's when looking for a greek restaurant and the food was great staff very helpful but if you dine in recognize that it isn't a restaurant so much as a mediterranean grocery with 6 tables to sit atthe only reason they don't get five stars is the setting great food in a grocery store,positive
Ipt9ga67vVC_2ob3YmVwNA,i have never been disappointed at this restaurant the food is delicious the wait staff is very attentive and most of all they make you feel at home i really love coming here for all of those reasons anytime i come with a friend who has not been there yet they are so amazed at the menu choices there are so many options for breakfast and lunch love this place,positive
3bZADX_g9efvqGXaAY7Kbg,i was dying to go here we'd been to the petros in solvang a while back and being an optimist imagined it would be the same or better on a recent visit to sb we went in for dinner first of all the service was outstandingwarm and welcoming eager and friendly very caring and kind people from the hostess to our server to the managereveryone was so very sweet it made up for our letdown with the food to be fair we live in the bay area with kokkari in sf and evvia in palo alto and we'd had an unbelievable time at petros solvangso we went in with expectations off the chart maybe this was the problemit wasn't that their food was intrinsically bad it was good it just didn't sparkle didn't blow our minds    the watermelon and feta salad was good albeit not super alive with flavor the grilled octopus was a good dose of protein though with slightly muddled flavor we were expecting it to be charred and tender which is a tough call for octopus while we were looking over the menu we didn't see lamb listed and were expressing disappointment to each other our server who had not yet come to our table and was doing something else at the adjacent table overheard us and came over to reassure he was just so sweet going over not one or two but three different lamb options i mean seriously what kind of greek restaurant doesn't have lamb right petros had terrific lamb options we had the lamb loin or was it the chops they were good again not so memorable that i'd track down a postcard and write home about them but they were good enough that we scarfed down everything  at some point during our dinner someone spilled water everywhere near our table on the floor and the manager was on top of it asking someone to mop it up before we tripped we didn't stay for dessert but i'd give anything to live near petros and i could go in for lunch anytime we'd have a ball btw the next day we were having dinner across the street at sunset and petros was the site for an outdoor wedding partyreception we watched a gorgous and touching showtraffic stopped on the street while the bride and groom took photos her white train trailing the street veil blowing in the breeze    i damn near cried,positive
Sd8NrlgB6SY6GEtIjPupfA,what a nice little find  i love greek food but don't live or work near any of my old favorites anymore  this place does not have a dining area  it is drive thru and walk up  you can sit on the small little patio if weather is right  the food has wonderful flavor and the salad was perfectly crisp and not watery  the guy at the window i assume the owner was super nice and had a great personality  i agree with someone that said the area is sketch  glad i took my chances though  i ordered the chicken hummus sandwich  next time i'll pass on the hummus as the textures don't go well together  chicken sauce and bread were amazing,positive
9mE7Xp0hH6TMv3eaf2Ylxg,this was our 2nd time at red pony and we weren't disappointed my husband ordered the lamb and i had the beef tourenedos both were superb we also split a caesar salad and the spaghetti squash with brie i highly recommend both of these dishes probably among the best i've had as far as a salad and side dish  service is great knowledgeable staff and excellent wine list we will definitely return for more dining oh and make  reservations unless you want to wait,positive
Wjof0zPFYr1MlgvenXohFw,after closing for a couple months this summer we knew the restaurant was going to reopen again this last week but when we could no longer find their old website or facebook page we began to wonder what was going on so we called and found out that they had new owners  a couple who had worked there many years ago when george was still the owner so with a bit if apprehension we figured we would give it a try when we showed up albeit pretty early on a saturday night and no one else was there we wondered if we had made the right decision but we talked to the new chefowner dave and his wife who was our server for a while and figured we'd give it a try they brought out some complimentary olives and cheese while we were deciding on what to order and then also let us taste a couple different wines so we could decide on which one we wanted to order we figured the best way to test out the new owners was to order a couple of our favorites so i ordered the salmon and my wife ordered the shrimp kastella the new owners have modified these items to some degree  for instance the shrimp came on a bed of rice instead of being served over pasta and the salmon was served over rice instead of over garlic mashed potatoes but when we mentioned that our server told us they would be happy to fix those dishes the old way if we wanted my greek salad was great  the greens were very fresh and the dressing was perfectthe salmon was cooked perfectly and came with some really tasty rice and some perfectly grilled vegetables that were also very well seasoned my wife's shrimp was also cooked perfectly and very tastyby the time we were done eating the place began to fill up and really the only negative thing i can say at all is that it took a while for them to process our credit card because the server got so busy but that was such a minor issuewe'll definitely be back,positive
KJScP6bDksIDN329d6s8IQ,what a great little diner everything was so yummy you can tell a great restaurant by how busy it is and this place was hoping great service from the minute you walk in i wish i lived here because this would be my weekly breakfast spot they are open 24 hours so they do have lunch and dinner options we had breakfast and everything was delicious gonna have to hit this one more time before leaving tampa dont miss out on this little gem,positive
LGYIhGqbYakMMdsn_GCzJg,you have to start with what i believe is the best toasted ravioli in saint louis  as a main dish i have had multiple pizzas and pasta dishes all of which have been fantastic  it can be a little challenging getting in but the hosts are efficient and pleasant,positive
ADe114o7Z4vb1O6HkM6YEA,i usually come to greek lady once a week since am from nj my wife loves the grilled chicken with the baked veggies i get the gyro platter with baked vegies and a small greek salad i wished they dint chop up the chicken in the chicken platter but i guess that's the way they do it the pita bread should be grilled a bit more to make it crisper and they should have a small house salad like a greek salad that comes with the gyro plate that you can get ala carte all and all the place rocks its clean and the service is quick,positive
TV81bpCQ6p6o4Hau5hk-zw,why 4 stars because the greek salad was worth an update         i visited hellas several years ago and have always had it on my list to return i originally rated it 3stars due to a very average gyro but i know that hellas is a treasured staple of tampa bay and tarpon springs so i wanted to give them a second chance i don't live anywhere near tarpon springs though so it took me a while to make my return visiti had been craving a greek salad and the hellas version of that absolutely did not disappoint i'd recently settled for a greek salad from a fast casual spot near my house and it was a you get what you pay for situation but the hellas greek salad hit the spot for everything i wanted it to be however i stand by my 5 year old rating of the gyro my wife opted for one and it was as pedestrian as i remembered it to be in addition i asked for a side of gyro meat for my salad and it was barely room temperature which was a bit offputtingwe also hit up the bakery afterward where i scored a mil'fe and a coconut pasta which is basically just a coconut piecustard concoction both were just ok i also had a greek coffee which was a shot of espresso with sugar but they leave the grounds at the bottom of the cup they're compacted so it's not like you're tasting ground coffee bits throughout it was pretty tasty actuallyone shoutout i wanted to give is to our server i screwed up by not getting her name but she was amazing despite hellas very crowded and loud i commended her ability to act like we were the only customers in the restaurantso to sum it all upgreek salad 5starsgryo 3starsbaked goods 3starsservice 5starsa round 4star average,positive
DeY0JL4MpfKfB4jf2Bx68w,typical tourist spot but it was actually pretty cool to see all the sponges that they got out of the water a couple of the boats were rinsing out the sponges and laying them out in the sun to dry on the sidewalk which took available walking space on the sidewalk but it was kind of interesting to see the different sizes and shapes of the sponges up close and in real life,positive

BJXK4B2N8CLoc__SoDNPjg,i have always had a good experience here foodwise  i have had to wait a long time for very simple food though  i once waited almost 20 minutes for a gyro salad  i learned my lesson and now always call ahead  the gyro meat is good and far from dry any time i have had it  i have started asking for the dressing on the side of the salad because they use a little too much if your salad comes dressed  the baklava are really yummy and fresh too,positive

BmwHAMrY-Tdrz6PApscqEg,our family dines here regularly it's a great place to go if you're looking for something different to switch things up from the usual burgers and mexican foodthe gyros are very tasty and the portions are filling some of the specialty dishes are a bit overpriced in my opinion but we still order them because you can't just eat gyros,positive
Rz-tyulofvEnNeyQwFZw_w,this restaurant just opened earlier this month and we have already been there twice   this is a true family owned restaurant in this day of chain restaurants and fast food venues  a rarity  daughter waits on tables son is cooking in the back and dad oversees and checks to see how everyone is enjoying   the food is not all greek  there are several middleeastern and turkish offerings including kebobs shawarma as well as gyros falafel and hummus my husband's favorite  we love the chicken shawarma and greek salad   everything is fresh and made to order   i highly recommend you discover this gem for yourself,positive
hVi4_rFTj0fsbfxa4X4OAA,went with family this past sunday  started with calamari which was the most tenderest we ever had  i started with the avgolemono soup had the beeflamb gyro platter with potatoes and pita and finished up with baklava  everything was fresh delicious and filling  we all took boxes with the balance of our dinner home with us  prices great staff friendly and it had quite a few locals eating there  you know if locals frequent a restaurant it has to be good  not like the many tourist traps on the main street,positive
h6gEB2JmquKkuirJnrHk3g,the food was great no question about it  fresh healthy ingredients different choices than you would get at say a greek place though similar flavors  the only thing i have to say that's negative and why i didn't give them 5 stars was the service  it was so slow  the wait staff seemed disorganized and started freaking out when it started getting busy  not many tables but if you get there before 530 we went on a friday you'll be fine,positive
sDHUhFN0Kcbd8TUqn0NB7A,plenty of foodwas hoping for more spices since i used to live in the med areaa little pricey though,positive
E1R5kDIN-ij1--MAD2qmHA,this restaurant recently opened in a strip mall near where i live so i thought i'd give it a try  walking inside i was very pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere it's not at all what you would expect from the outside  mood lighting and mood music attentive waitstaff a menu that is neither too vast nor too small  reasonably priced and generous portions of food both my daughter and i really enjoyed our meals  conversation was not competing with the music and i noticed the staff attempts to space patrons at least one table away from other patrons when possible making the meal a little more intimate  this would be a great place for a date but they also have kid portions so it's a place you can bring the kids too  my daughter was the only child in the restaurant on a wednesday evening  we'll definitely go back,positive
ruE_DRE6fTIE6who59hdfQ,so disappointing  thursday dinner maybe 630 at the central ave location on st pete decent food but big service issuesmanagement  the tampa location in b b downs is great runs like a rolex    this location is run poorly rundown of the issues sat outside  waitress masked came over timely and took drink and appetizer order  so far so good  guy on the table next to us chatting up a female patron starts smoking rancid cigarette smoke wafted over to us  waitress come back and can sense our my annoyance and says something got the guy   wow  turns out it was the manager soon thereafter appetizer came out highlight tirokafteri an absolutely lovely feta lemon herbed cheese spread with warm soft pita wedges ordered entrees and service went south  wrong gyro platter brought out got to keep it cause it was touched  reaction by the guy in next table smoking manager had gone back inside suggested we had gotten his food  tried to tell the waitress but she gave some convoluted explanation that the gyro trio was on two larger pitas because they ran out of smaller pitas ignoring that there was only one type of meat on the dish instead of chicken lamb beef on the trio platter oh fries were awesome the acropolis salad is really good and the basic gyros as well but honestly not better the hungry greek for the price halfway through the two entrees the third entree the salmon had yet to appear and no cocktail yet despite being ordered with the appetizer   two visits from the waitress later finally the cocktail arrived  brought out by the bartender who said she never got a ticket and soon thereafter an underwhelming salmon  waitress was very sweet but so many glitches won't return to this location,negative
yfmh5pifOvdQBfsEUL86ww,trash place hosting staff was ridiculously rude they wouldn't seat our table for two because they had just booked up reservations but the restaurant was 80 empty we asked for recommendations for another restaurant and the hostess said there were restaurants at the willow grove mall several miles away luckily there was a fantastic japanese restaurant right next door there were also several others right up the street we went to the japanese place and had a lovely meal just skip athena and go straight there oh and when we left the japanese place and walked by athena and hour later there were still plenty of open tables,negative
oRQKEVR6uNlV8jnUAaPgpg,dinner for 2 at a byob as far as i'm concerned was too   i ordered the halibut fish which is usually very pricey anywhere you go but also usually good my fish was so undercooked it was cool to the touch and not edible i had broken it apart thinking it was just the ends but it was all the way through so i asked for it to be cooked now here's where imo they failed the gordon ramsey test  they apparently just reheated what was on my plate making the fish spongy rubbery and still inedible imo for the price of the dish it should have been discarded and a new piece served cooked i'll make short mention of the green puree that my fish was served on i'm still unsure if it was asparagus or green bean pureeif i can't tell by the taste that's not a good sign now after all this i was still willing to say i would try again a 2nd time until i saw one of the servers resetting a table that i was facing where the patrons had a dog that was given a water bowl sweet except i believe the table was never properly cleaned off and someone had place the used dog dish on the table from the wet dirt ground outdoor dinning and then reset the table while the dog dish was still on the table turning the wine glasses upside down so the drinking edge was on the table near the unclean dog dish then the server picked up the dog dish with her fingers in the bowl and i'm fairly certain did not wash her hands as i saw her in too short time walking new patrons to their table with a menu in her hands that she then handed to them as they were seatedyuck would not go back,negative
UgXqPDWEMtPaptUZ_KsSOw,i am beyond disappointed with our experience today we frequent tarpon springs and often stop in mama's as we love their sangria to have a waitress be so rude and make you feel as if you are bothering her is unacceptable even after complaining to another employee she continued to argue with us stating that we must have been confused she then rubbed my arm and told me to relax unacceptable and will not be forgotten,negative
7bLzkndhqE6ap3WEsn7fSg,the first time i went to mazzah the food was on the better side of meh  the second time around was not so great and it will probably ensure that i don't return  we ordered falafel and waited forever for our order  and when it came out of the kitchen we realized why  i took a bite into it and chipped a tooth  it was akin to eating grapenuts  plus now i have a rather large dental bill  not a huge fan,negative
zHJ5Ppr5Ru0IFORwG7kekA,my coworker and i went to this place for lunch twice and we had upset stomach after getting the gyro sandwich both times also the owner are not friendly at all there are a lot of good places in brentwood i won't go back for sure,negative
36rz3AMPh8ETMJq7cTG2Rw,we've been regulars here for several years  the service is spotty but the food is consistently good  tonight  we entered the restaurant about a half hour before closing  we were greeted by a server behind the counter yelling across the restaurant we're only doing to go we close in a half hour i've worked in restaurants a very long time  and you seat customers until you close  part of working in a restaurant is understanding that you might have to stay a little late  it's called customer service  it's sad  because the food here is good  it's just not good enough to justify the rude inconsiderate service,negative
ADe114o7Z4vb1O6HkM6YEA,greek lady  i used to enjoy going to greek lady the delivery drivers most of whom are north africans were always fun to converse with and they were always very polite and respectful after my wife moved here in january we had frequented the spot as it was always decent food and the portions were huge but all that changedwe had ordered a salad and a souvlaki  simple fair for this establishment but the salad was just downright horrible the oil tasted as if it had gone rancid  a possibility if they keep it out and near the hot stove when i brought this to the attention of the manager he chose to inform me that maybe you're just not used to how it tastes i rebutted that we eat here frequently and know what it should taste like his final reply was to shrug his shouldersso my wife and i shrugged ours vowing to never return and telling as many people as we know that greek lady doesn't care about the satisfaction of its customersor maybe they just don't know how their salads should taste,negative
Wq_1vdxlxFiZnU0-LmE4fQ,i saw the ratings and figured why not and came and got a greek salad and hummus to go i really don't like writing a negative review and only have one other time i have the utmost respect for small businesses and always want to give them my business but after i ate i was immediately feeling sick which just got worse from there like up through the night hugging the porcelain sick the food was ok but upchucking until 5 am the next day from definite food poisoning was not,negative
DeY0JL4MpfKfB4jf2Bx68w,i'm guessing i don't get the big deal about this place yes it's full of sponges they get 1 star for that 10 to park that is a crap way to be a gateway to your town especially with 5 and 3 parking nearby nothing that fascinating to see here,negative
b0YICdDCw8Ck6hJPc1Z5HQ,been huge fans since he opened on spruce st   third time at south truly fantastic meal as always our server was a true gentleman and went out of his way to accommodate us two issues that make me give it one star runnerbusserexpeditor walks by grabs my near empty cocktail away from table and asks if i'd like another i explained i wasn't finished with the one in her hand so wrongyet happens at some of the finest places the hummusmushrooms came with 3 wedges of grilled pita seriously the hummusshrooms were plentyful but not the pita then before we even had a chance to ask for more pita a runner walks by and asks if we'd like more  and we said yes but they charged us 2 we noticed on the check didn't say a word but we thought that was unnecessary and lame the grilled pita wasn't as good as the last many times it was stiff cold and unseasoned,negative
BjB3V_pwlTfuxb2s9rqE_g,i placed my order online got notice that would be around 3045 mins waited over 15 hrs and no order ever showed up never got a call or text message about the order just nothing as my family waited and waited we ordered out vs going to the grocery store so after waiting for dinner now 818 at night having to run to the grocery store for food then have to wait longer to cook said food i did see an email later on that they refunded my card shortly after the order was placed so i am not sure why the order was canceled but more so why no one called or text me to let me know the order was canceled if they would have called me i would have ordered from another restaurant now we will be eating what would have been a 730 dinner after 9 pm i was really looking forward to the gyros but i will probably never order from this restaurant again,negative
UgXqPDWEMtPaptUZ_KsSOw,my wife daughter and i went here the other day as we scored some great coupons during black friday the coupons were buy one and get one up to a 1500 value there were no restrictions at all on the coupons when i showed the waitress prior to ordering she tried to tell me we could not use them both i told her we were going to order one dinner to go as our eldest daughter could not join us she then tried to say it is only one coupon per table i told her again it does not say that she went to ask the owner she came back and said it was okay and to order anything we wanted the food was good although the beers were tiny when the check came she took the liberty of adding an 18 gratuity to the check i have been here before and this was new i understand she wanted  to insure she was tipped on the prediscount amount i have worked in food service before and know how to tip but the total was still a lot higher than i expected my wife and i had been out all day and it was a good day she told me to let it go because she could tell by the look on my face i was going to get into it with someone i let it go  i called tonight and asked to place a to go order just to see if i would get the same total guess what they overcharged us by 20 and added the tip i warn anyone from eating at this establishmentmy initial review does not show up so i posted it again,negative
i6I9-e_2VNc8MX8noUKHdw,went to this location a couple of times and had bad service both times  it took 15 minutes to be offered water when we were first seated and the restaurant was not very busy took almost 40 mins to get food my vegetarian chili was cold when she brought it out i would have sent it back but the next time the server came back to our table was to drop the bill food probably would have been ok if it was hot but i won't be going back my parent's food was nothing memorable too bad,negative

wFFHt-ixlw_3kZ6kfioMMA,up until my most recent experience at this restaurant i would have gladly rated it 4 stars one of the better mediterranean restaurants in the tampa bay area i would say until i came down with food poisoning my husband ordered the gyro platter and myself the greek salad with chicken on it i gave half of my chicken to my husband who did not get sick from the food through deduction this leaves the romaine tomatoes cucumbers olives and feta as the host of the contamination notice there was no mention of potato salad which is a staple of greek salads because byblos does not include that for some reason i ate it around 8pm on friday evening and fell violently ill around 430am which went on for another 5 hours after the vomiting subsided i felt nauseous and had no appetite until the following tuesday and that is no exaggeration when i was feeling better i sent a message to byblos via their website respectfully informing them of my illness from their food and also as a warning to check their produce so no one else got sick seeing how i had oatmeal from a canister that i had been using all week and no lunch on that friday the only thing that could have caused that was their food since that is what i was vomiting at 430am i received a short email back from them 48 hours later stating they were sorry i fell sick but that as a matter of fact 36 other greek salads had been ordered that day now i'm no mathematician but i find it highly unlikely that 1 head of romaine 1 tomato 1 jar of kalamata olives 1 cucumber and 1 block of feta cheese were used to make 36 salads either way i cannot in good faith recommend this restaurant to anyone there is a superior mediterranean restaurant on kennedy in south tampa that i should have just gone to in the first place,negative
lPday_z2XpRJqbFWyCh6dw,i had a deal coupon so i stopped in to see how this place was i don't know what they thought they were creating but it wasn't at good combination of flavors neither me or my friend ate our dinners it was an attempt at fusion but it was too sweet and not ok ive never felt like going back,negative
0K-z6hRV2RhvEC3z9GFG7A,ok maybe i just know good greek food and these people don't  i went today the place was empty i ordered a ice water and it was clearly tap water grossi was excited to find a mom and pop i got a gyro looked huge it was but the meat was so dry it was like jerky i couldn't drink my water being tap and all i was starving since i didn't have time for breakfast in desperate need of moisture i had to get up and ask for more sauce it took 30min by the way to get our mealmy coworkers shrimp was so over done he took a bite and went to tear it off and it flew onto my other coworkers shirtso go ahead and eat over cooked food and call it goodi'll stick to down town gyro so i can have a good meal,negative
5t-25pkm9ovVcbH3BBIpCw,this new greek restaurant where athena used to be is more diner food than great greek cooking first of all they serve perrier instead of greek sparkling water the appetizer of greek meatballs was fair and the spanikopita had a hard crust made from what i was told was phyllo not the usual light and airy phyllo the service was average and the bill a bit expensive for the fair quality of the food worth a try but i wouldn't go out of my way,negative
Ql5icyL9DGN9qn1-tUaN-g,yikes  this place is not good  the service is terrible  there is literally 8 employees and 4 customers here right now and everyone is standing around gossiping and cussing instead of taking care of a customers food was not so good  the yelp ratings here are spot on    go to miguel's next door,negative
v4O1bXBFIkDuH8RY5EzlOA,we arrived with excitement at trying more greek food at least that's what we thought  we left feeling sick to our stomachs and bitter over how much we spent on such a medicore dinneri came here with my mother and sister last week for dinner after searching for nearby greek restaurants we decided to come here after seeing the really good reviews at first we had some concerns since some people had left reviews saying that their dinner was bland we aren't particularly picky so we listened to the majority of reviews instead we had a little trouble finding the place and from the outside it does not look the most appealing my mom actually wanted to go somewhere else after seeing the outside but never judge a book by it's cover so we encouraged her to stay the place was empty except for one couple and a group of two that came in later i don't remember exactly what i ordered but it had lamb and rice and came with tzatziki and was 17 for the dish my sister ordered the beef which came with the same stuff and my mom ordered some beef with tomatoes and pine nuts we started off with the saganaki it was okay we had never tried it before so we can't compare when our food came it smelled really good and the portion sizes were huge unfortunately it smelled and looked better than it tasted i took a bite of lamb and it had absolutely no flavor i wondered if perhaps it was because i needed to eat it with  the tzatziki sauce and the rice it tasted a little better but even the tzatziki sauce tasted extremely bland i was hungry so i tried to keep eating it but the more i ate the less that lamb tasted like meat and more like some kind of excessively greasy processed tasteless meat byproduct the only edible thing in the dish was the rice none of us were able to eat much more than a few bites i finished one piece of meat out of the six that came with the dish because i just couldn't eat it my sister ate a little more than i did but her beef dish was equally bland my mom was unable to finish her dish as well so we got carry out boxes because we felt bad about wasting so much food especially since it was on the pricier side we ended up throwing them all away when we got back to the hotel because none of us had the stomach to take another bitethis was quite possibly the worst food i have ever eaten my dining hall at university is pretty bad but their gyros and lamb meat taste like lamb and are well seasoned save yourself the trouble and don't stop by here for dinner as we were leaving we passed by a woman who had come out from the back and was bending over a table for two where one of the customers was telling her word for word your food sucks we didn't have the courage to say it then but it's really awful,negative
b8Scn6Wn_dymh7Nc6tI0FQ,i went here for the first time with my husband for lunch based on the good yelp reviews it's a small restaurant and was not crowded  there were only 3 other parties dining when we arrived  we were greeted quickly and served bread with an olive oilpesto dip  the oiltopesto ratio was too high and the bread was nothing special but it was nice to have something to nibble on  we quickly ordered drinks and our entrees  i was on my lunch break from work and didn't want the meal to take more than an hour  i typically have no problems with this at any of my other lunch spots in tarpon i began to get concerned about timing here when it took about 10 minutes for our iced tea to arrive our server only had two other tables but had no sense of urgency  both my husband and i agreed that the iced tea had an unusual flavor too almost like it was tea from a can  it ended up taking 50 minutes for our food to arrive i was very close to just walking out before the food came but i had already devoted so much time to the meal we weren't the only table that had to wait a long time for their food  we had been there about 40 minutes when two other tables seated before us received their entrees  my husband had the gyro which he said was good but nothing special  i had ordered the ultimate wrap which had both chicken and pork  both meats were seasoned and cooked very well and the red pepper feta sauce on the wrap was delicious  we both also had the french fries with a dillfeta sauce for a side  the fries were just ok and it's hard for me not to love any fries with cheese sauce   although the food was decent i could not enjoy my meal because i was stressed about getting back to work  as soon as the food was dropped i asked for the check  server came back about 5 minutes later  to ask how everything was  and didn't bring the check after another reminder we finally got the check and a togo box since i didn't have time to finish my meal  bottom line  i won't be returning to this restaurant  there are much better greek places with better service in the tarpon area  the customers at the restaurant all appeared to be retiree aged and enjoying their meals  maybe this is the usual crowd and the kitchenservers are not used to having customers on any sort of timeline  if you don't mind waiting a ridiculous amount of time for a mediocre meal  then i suggest you give this place a try,negative
kburcuSQtWvwI4cA44reDg,had lunch here the other day as i was craving a gyro i ordered the platter that came with a small salad for 1100 as that was the cheapest gyro option on the menu i was highly disappointed in the amount of actual gyro meat that came with the very small gyro for 11 i would expect a substantial amount if you go to seminole subs largo subs or any other greek restaurant you get substantially more quantity for the money  they used to be better i will not be back,negative
ovUZ8Ff8QRNi0x2xJ1RWWg,be warned  the menu make look the same but the recipes are different their special salad isn't so special anymore it was once made with a beautiful herbed lemony dressing but is now drowned in heavy flavorless oil my last salad had no mint nuts apples nor raisins  lettuce  cucumber bathed in oil nothing special about that  their hummus was once my favorite it was smooth like butta and seasoned to perfection it is now grainy bitter and borderline sour the last chicken plate i ordered left an oil slick in my mouth  meals were once served with an entire round of bread now come with only a quarter of pita round also their prices have increased i would have been happy to pay higher prices if the quality of food had remained the same  however both quality and quantity are now diminished,negative

I2ISRV7IybkMc3HEYKUE9g,ive been to audrey claire many times and counted it as a favorite restaurant so i recommended it to the boyfriend on a special celebratory night outour reservation was for 9pm but when we arrived we were told the kitchen was closing soon although the answer was no when we asked if that meant we shouldnt order we should have read between the lines and just leftthe food and service was the worst ive ever experienced at any restaurant it took forever to get in our order although there were only 4 other tables and they were eating my maple pork chop was cold in bits and searing hot in others which only means microwave the steak was completely raw in the middle although we requested welldone the food was so badly made the butter plopped on the meats was not even melting the rude server did not have a problem talking over me as i explained our disappointmentneedless to say im not going here ever again and you shouldn't after 9pm i gave it onestar because we were given complimentary dessert and only had to wait 15 minutes to get change from our paid check,negative
UgXqPDWEMtPaptUZ_KsSOw,i purchased a 50 gift certificate on restaurantcom for mama's greek cuisine  i have been there several times and have always had great food and good service  we had a group of seven including two children who ordered from the children's menuthe food was okay but not as good as it has been on other visits  the pastas were a bit overcookedour bill came to 162  the server declined the gift certificate stating that the owner will no longer honor the 50 certificates  seriously  after two phone calls to the owner presumably she offered to honor it for 25   i refused intending to call restaurantcomthe experience has put me off mama's for a while  the owner signed a contract to honor the certificates but refused them  it will be a long time before i go back if ever,negative
lqL7SQ191yU1fOBrsyvoTA,waited forever for soup to go will not return not very good customer service,negative
bgxDswHIdFP0Go0pNfyAAw,the food here is great as a vegan i appreciate the fact that they label veganfriendly items on their menu the falafel sandwich is greathowever shortly after witnessing a mouse run out of the bathroom and along a wall i then got to watch an employee kill the mouse with a broom which as an animal lover counteracted any goodwill their intermittentlyveganfriendly menu generated,negative
9PbAOIYVVllOq6QOXoXoBg,boy you really gotta love the online reputation specialist that cava has hired to try to defend the garbage food and subpar service at its newlyacquired franchise storeshi insert name gosh thanks for the feedback we're sorry your experience was bad we hope you give us another chanceit really instills the notion that this place will ever be anything remotely like what it used to besad,negative
ctC-HU2Jbv04I42ykXFjLA,the food is good  just be prepared to waaaaaaiiiiitttt  we placed a to go order inperson  after 20 minutes i had to go pay my meter another drawback of wc because it was taking so long  i asked about the order and they finally saw it on the receipt printer  they hadn't even started it  super frustrating  as others have commented the service is at times rude and they will make you wait  it appears quickserve but don't be mistaken  bring a bottle of wine  gina is fun,negative
H3IC23nd7_PAwW2rPwS5qw,the tomatoes and potato salad in the greek salad were good that's all i can say about the food the staff were very friendly and efficient,negative
mUIBtlWNPD7sz3rGGWQ1RA,i ordered an 8 salad for lunch  it was a pile of leaves with some onion and a couple radishes  it couldn't have been more than 100 calories  the dressing was lovely and the leaves were fresh fava leaves and sea beans  but there should be some sort of regulation requiring that a salad include a starch or protein or both if you are going to serve it as a meal  i had to get more food immediately after leavingalso it was uncomfortably loud  they need to work on their acoustics,negative
BM92j54mc-c-6MWqWSimRw,i dined there tonight for the first time   very disappointedentree selections for served on plates that would be small size even for appetizer portion   no room to cut up the food or put any other portions of food from our shared appetizers   appetizer combo plate served on a larger platter  but not even a serving spoon to portion the food out   unbelievable   whoever is running the kitchen and preparing the food is apparently mindlessi would not return,negative
H3IC23nd7_PAwW2rPwS5qw,not a fan of the atmosphere but the food is phenomenal called in my order at 630 on a saturday night stuffed grape leaves  greek salad was told it would be 30 min  showed up at 715 and now they are saying another 15 minutes not too sure why they didn't just say an hour they have in the past so now i am a pretty dissatisfied hungry customer,negative
sDHUhFN0Kcbd8TUqn0NB7A,the lady and the guy are so nice but the gyros are just giant piles of meat with bad veggies on some bread i want to love it but i just can't,negative
fKDV_dlDhXd7P5kZi97Kng,okay it's not like we have anywhere in our neighboorhood where we can find something cheap and mediocre so let's not just throw the spot to the dogs sure for a few bucks more we can go next door and get some pretty tasty chinese but sometimes you want a little greasei've had breakfast and lunch here the home fries are horrible they are frozen shredded potatoes thrown on the grill pass on them get a breakfast sandwich or something else the pizza is pretty decentthey are running a special right now 299 for a small pizza pie on thursdays pick up only hey the economy sucks where else are you going to eat a small pie for 299,negative
I2ISRV7IybkMc3HEYKUE9g,terrible service sat us 1 hour past our reservation time with little apologies sold out of nearly everything i will never come back here the condescending hipster waiters should lose the attitude too,negative

3bZADX_g9efvqGXaAY7Kbg,sorry to do this but my experience at petros was unforgettably awful i had reservations for 715pm got there at 7 and were seated i'm thinking awesomewell not so much1 we were seated wayyyy in the back despite the fact that there was plenty of room in the main room and no those tables were never filled during our visit2 after almost half an hour we were served bread but only because i had to ask the busser who was very nice btw3 almost an hour later i asked the busser where the waiter was he said dimitri the main server there first has to tell us the specialsand only he is allowed to do that which i thought was odd especially because i felt the busser was competent enough to help us out with at least thatbut apparently that's how they were running the kitchen that night it was valentines night 4 dimitri finally came introduced himself and told us the specials we wasted no time in placing our order as we had already being there for at least  1 hr and half and were almost done with our champagne bottle which thank god we brought on our own5 35 long minutes later i decided that my spouse and i had waited far too long and we were both starving and tired of hard bread we dropped a few bucks for the complimentary bread and began to walk out at this point it was almost 9pmsomething i have never done at a restaurant btw by this time we saw 4 tables that came before us sit eat pay and go seconds later i see the busser and another staff member come out of the kitchen with our food and they looked at us and asks where are you going your food is readywe calmly explained how felt with our experience there so far and decided not to wait any longer it was then we became vip lol and dimitri jumped to get us and apologized from left to right and began to recover from the situation he explained that they were under staffed and the kitchen was backed upseriously he gave us a free champagne bottle which we didn't need as we had brought our own and threw in a free dessert which we wouldn't have ordered nonetheless we appreciated him trying to recover unfortunately the damage had being done and when i think of the negative part of my trip to santa barbara i think of petros again sorry guys and it left me wandering was it because they saw it was two gay men having dinner together on valentines day or was it because they saw two hispanic gay men having dinner together on valentines nighti hope not i hope it truly was a lack of staffing issuebtw the food was just ok not worth the two hour wait that's for sure,negative
GgcDDkFQuCU5puBqq0lImQ,the food is very good but the service is seriously lacking be prepared to wait i've been here several times and have had the same experience,negative

HmeKJIWJaJ7u8V9NhnZIEg,i am blown away by all the praise and positive reviews have i gone to the wrong place i have waited for simple greek to open for so long boy was i disappointedfirst i was surprised by the 100 upcharge for grilled steak there was no disclosure about itthen i was put off by the single paper bag for all heavy contents i made a point of holding the bag by the bottom no help  the soggy bag fell apart right in my hands containers tumbled out creating quite a mess in the car there were even no napkins in the bag to help with a cleanupwhen i called to report the issue and request a refund i was told i would get a callback the next day yeah still holding my breathwhatever food survived was horrible sour and salty soups overcooked shrimp  and potatoes the rest  barely edible so much for local greek cuisine never again,negative
ruE_DRE6fTIE6who59hdfQ,i've heard good things about the food but unfortunately the service was so bad we left before we received our food and when i say bad i mean bad the worst i have ever been treated in a restaurant sad because i live 2 blocks away,negative
lNXAV6t34fqAdGa3MrDxkg,not my fave for greek mediterranean but in nola beggers can't be choosers when looking for non buttered non fried food greek salad was ok add honey or sugar to the dressing to take the acid level down,negative
KVFUBgmPEHGUaJNkpMGcLw,the manager elias is incompetent has zero social skills and clearly doesn't understand anything about restaurant hospitality i honestly think he's bringing the entire establishment down and he's fully aware of his ineptitude as evident by the fact he would not make eye contact when we requested an explanation for his disrespectful treatment of our party it's a shame because the food is great but i would never go back to this place until the manager is fired read the other reviews that clearly point to unfit management excellent bartender,negative
CuyQt_cUFS1i738GXTNciw,went to effie's last night with a group of 10 friends the food was pretty good the moussaka is insanely large and hearty and the service during the meal was fine ambience is nice  i especially like the garden in the backthe reason that i left the meal rather unhappy was the sequence of events that occurred when we were paying the bill first of all the menu said 18 gratuity included for parties of 8 or more when it says that on the menu you would expect that it would be the actual policy so they brought us the bill which was basically the tape reel of a calculator and we figured that the tip was included because it said it would be on the menu am i wrong here peopleafter we paid the server came back all puppyeyed with the bill and some change and asked if there was something wrong with our meal she insinuated that our tip was insufficient and then explained that they didn't apply the policy they had clearly printed on the menu because it was a slow night or something that pissed me off if you have a policy printed on your menu customers expect you to enforce it again please correct me if i am wrong here or you should tell us when you give us the bill that tip is not included like it says on the menu i liked effie's before last night but i was left with a rather poor taste in my mouth and pocket and don't know if i'll be going back anytime soon,negative
FcAfurc3pR_6s8T6XI_VyA,the people seem to be friendly and the service was ok i got a gyro sandwich and fries the fries were fresh and good as far as the sandwich the vegetables seem to be ok the bread was stale and chewy the meat was very bland and dry it was hard to chew like beef jerky  i might possibly try the pizza or the calzones in the future i don't believe i'll ever try another gyro sandwich from here the whole reason i came,negative
4jkpycTldteoQnKK7VPSxA,this was my first visit to athens in bellevue upon arriving i was seated fairly quickly i was struck by how noisy and how bright the place was the atmosphere felt more akin to a fast food restaurant and i would not recommend it if you wanted an intimate or relaxing dining experience after i was seated my server disappeared and i was left waiting almost 15 minutes at my table even though the restaurant was not busy the server who eventually visited my table was very friendly which partially made up for the wait i ordered the vegetarian greek platter and an oliveshummus appetizer the olives and hummus appetizer was tasty  the pita was warm and plump the hummus was not special but good nonetheless and for the price i thought it was a good dealthe vegetarian platter however left a lot to be desired the moussaka was meh ok kind of tasted like some frozen gourmet meal there was a small dish of vegetables in tomato sauce that i actually thought was quite tasty the rice was a huge no  it tasted like the kind that comes precooked in a bag there was a cheesy potato side dish that was tasty  but then again it was almost pure cheese so hard to mess up the portion was big  i had enough to take to work for lunch the next dayas a bellevue resident i'm glad to see this place here the more variety of restaurants the better i say if you go here you will probably get something that tastes decent you will probably not get something amazing though the service is just ok and the atmosphere is dinerfast food joint i probably will not visit this place again i'd rather visit someplace outside of bellevue where for the same price the food is tastier the service better and the ambience cozier,negative
S9ufIJaPSq-Y5bRidcaDWg,this place could be better as far as the food is concerned but the service we received during our visit was great  the place also has a nice modern decorwe came in on a weekday night and the place was somewhat busy but we were seated immediately and our waitress brought over drinks and started taking our orders fairly quickly  we ordered the sampler appetizer hummus feta cheese greek olives tatziki 2 dolmathes and pita bread pieces everything i had from the sampler platter tasted good but that's where it stopped for me  for my entree i ordered some pastitsio and it was quite bland  i added some salt to it to give it a little bit more flavor as a result but it didn't end up tasting as great as i would have liked it to be  it was a goodsized portion but quite tasteless to be honest  my dining partner had the moussaka and said the same about his entree lacking any sort of flavor  we might give this place another try and hopefully their food quality improves  i'm a bit sad writing this review as we were quite excited for this new restaurant and was really hoping it could be a part of our dining out rotation but so far it's not making the cut,negative
DQnKn3e_PCa1E0OPcxVsBA,i went for dinner menu was very limited two small shrimp for 15 is ridiculous nice patio for dining but flies were too much too many good places around to go back here,negative
lNXAV6t34fqAdGa3MrDxkg,we ordered our food at the bar  but there was this rancid smell that i couldn't stomach at that moment i should have leftmy dining companionand i ordered our food togo we figured that you can't go wrong with hummus pita and falafels we were wrongwhen we got home the hummus tasted amazing for some reason i decided to break my falafels and dip them into the hummus to my horror  there was a rusted hook in my falafel yep a rusted hooked baked into the falafel i'm highly pissed because i had made it back home i called the restaurant and talked to the manager after sending him a picture he refunded our money as much as i love hookah and mediterranean food there is no way i would return to this place if the bar smelled and i had a rusted hook in my food i'm sure that the people are not taking care of the hookah and pipesavoid,negative
lNXAV6t34fqAdGa3MrDxkg,vibe was ok only because of the location and open air atmosphere the hookah wasn't assembled correctly making it difficult to enjoy after several different employee attempts the food was not good at all  just a prop for nice photos i hate i wasted my money this was a real expensive walking break,negative
1K7YpesPySJ8xOVKWEU67g,sorry but the dog inside the dining room eating food off the table killed it for me  i love dogs i have dogs but this went too far  restaurant owners said nothing to the dog owners,negative
KVFUBgmPEHGUaJNkpMGcLw,i went here for happy hour with a five coworkers on 51718  a couple of them left early and the bartender said just so you know i was just charging you for drinks along the way and those people who left didn't tip me  one of my coworkers through him 20 i guess to cover herself and the people who allegedly didn't tip  the people who left subsequently confirmed that they left tips on the bar when the departed  i was planning to tip for myself before i left  however before i had a chance to the 20 i had sitting on the counter disappeared  i perhaps should have made an issue of it at the time but didn't  i would suggest that if you go here for happy hour to keep an eye on your money  the bartender was very nice and i wanted to like him but i think he was doing some funny stuff as far as money is concerned,negative
Cjwb7VQGP0u2eWYj1wnO3g,forget about it happy hour is a joke 6 beers and 12 wine have to buy a drink down stairs to go to the rooftop not worth it plastic glasses for a 12 wine are you kidding me,negative
PHSda9zEwtFicCICD6TP1A,when i order a gyro i expect a fully assembled gyro  not deconstructed with just half of a tiny pita bread cut into three pieces where i can even assemble it myself,negative
Z7-p5k2Z89KAsWmy5jBJ3w,i am still standing at this disgusting place as i type this this morning after my dash tells me that my tire pressure is low i pull over into the empty lot behind this shit hole to take a look somehow i had utterly torn the tire and wasn't going to make it home on the flat i popped the trunk and removed my kit within minutes a grey haired man pulled in and slowed down almost to a stop but said nothing and kept going he pulled in the first space nearest the business and went inside after about 15 minutes i realized that my life g nuts were on too tight for my manual tool and i called for help with roadside assistance they arrived in under 20 minutes and began work immediately the grey haired man walks across the lot looks directly at me and says nothing he walks over to the front of my vehicle and speaks to the repair man saying how long are you going to be here if you're not gone by 11am i'm going to tow you pardon me but i'm certain that you're aware who the vehicle belongs to since you looked directly at me when you got here so show me some respect and direct your cowardly aggression towards me and not the service provider the repair technician was wonderful he responded directly at the man saying that he was helping me to change a tire obviously and that we would be out of the lot as soon as he could ensure my vehicle was driveable the grey haired man actually repeated the threat and said the lot was for customers only before turning around like a child and storming off complete ahole the tech was not moved he took time to complete the tire replacement even ensuring the tire had sufficient air we talked about a good place to purchase a new tire and then parted ways look it's 2017 i have no grand ideas about chivalry and have no expectations that a man would lend any help to a female stranger however i do expect that a business owner would show some damn compassion to a person making an active effort to not be stranded at no time was my vehicle unattended my time there was less than 40 minutes all in and quite honestly it's not throwing off the feng shui of your precious parking lot i will not support a business with pissy management i'm attaching picture to convey that i was not obstructing any entryexit lanes,negative
Wxcz9GHVfLUhER5FQAEDng,zoe's used to serve  quality food consistently however over the past few months the quality has gone down the tomato soup tastes different than previously they have changed their menu and no longer allow you to get a side of hummus also i found an actual rock in one of my meals that i could have chipped a tooth on i am disappointed in the changes over the past several months and miss the old zoe's,negative
Ge00ikbJsoSxuo8AcDCgOQ,a true study in mediocrity the nights with the greek dancing and music are extraobnoxious as well make sure to try the greek fries they are french fries with feta on top and a side of ketchup for a little extra greek dazzle the waitress called me 'darling',negative
_49FsmTfruZSTjxU4OwOsg,this is for a togo order i waited in line for a bit they only had one person taking orders and bagging orders so that took a whilewhen i finally got to order it was quick and easy what i was disappointed in was the actual food if you're expecting an actual gyro when you order one beware it doesn't taste like a traditional gyro the sauce was really watery so i was disappointedthey give you potato chips as a side which aren't that good either i just wasn't impressed with the food quality,negative
bN8LCQjzfbyrjKbHxRpSeA,i came in twice and was ignored each time  not one person acknowledged me when i finally ordered the woman at the register still didn't speak to me  even when i said hello ordered a chicken gyro it wasn't gyro meat it was baked and shredded chicken  not seasoned at all i don't recommend,negative
9FiiDY8Nrmdn81jHHvJSlA,at first we were utterly excited to have greek food the servings were great and the service was average the atmosphere was also decent the food was awful i'm not exaggerating when i say the food was awful the meat was dry salty tasteless and hard we all ordered a lot of different entrees with meat but one of us orders a salad out of six of us only the person who orders a salad was happy with food the rest of us had a very bad experience and the following morning we felt sick and nasty,negative
XABPGEqMuRN-WNpvk8kTVw,we didn't get offered boosters or high chairs for my kids i had to go find them because servers were so sparse service was meh probably because there weren't many servers the food was dry and unimpressive me and my husband had the gyro platter and the meat was so dry we couldn't chew the tzaziki had no flavor and the greek salad was just something i could have made at home plus it was expensive 14 for the platter which was only two pitas quarters and dry meat with tomato and onion plus we paid more to upgrade to a greek salad not sure why it was boring and cheap another note to add which certainly isn't the restaurant's fault if you have kids that don't like loud noises or are tired i would avoid the music was really loud and i had to take my spd kid outside so i couldn't eat i didn't care that i couldn't eat bc the food wasn't good anyways,negative
YHVrrdOqBEwRrW5XiNm3Fw,i am greek and this place is horrible so many better places in tarpon springs to eat this would definitely be my last choice any person that has given five stars including the owners wife theodora is lying  would never eat here again foods horrible service sucks this place will be closing soon,negative
JeO8XimR_a79kSoFkmNfUw,this was probably the worst restaurant i went to in tarpon springs the blonde waitress was absolutely miserable and standoffish the spanikopita was so overcooked i could barely cut it and it was tasteless the rice pilaf had tomato sauce on it and everything was overpriced for what you got definitely not worth it,negative
c9nlT6ZR_TAyTo8uwgU6Aw,i ordered take out from this place  i can tell they use frozen falafel patties  mine were barely cooked on the inside  that was disappointing  also the flavor on the mixed appetizer plate was a little off  i loved the baba ganoush but the hummos tasted bland as if it was from a jar  the grape leaves were the best out of everything i ordered   maybe the place is better if you eat there,negative
N29uir3jdwrezjQuy8YXTQ,tried dimitri's saturday for the first and unfortunately the last time i was hopeful after walking in to what seemed like a nice atmosphere we sat outside and it went downhill from there another couple was seated about 5 minutes after us and had their drink orders taken delivered and their orders put in before our server even came to our table  the cocktails we ordered were obviously not something the bartender was familiar with and they were awful  we did not order a second round  just stuck with water  the calamari was good and the rest of our meal was 'ok' the service was so slow that the other couple was gone before we got our meals which weren't anything so spectacular that we'd give it another try  very disappointing and expensive lesson learned,negative
BJXK4B2N8CLoc__SoDNPjg,gah i don't know what happened in the midst of all these great reviews i had a downright shitty experience maybe it was treat every 400th customer like crap day i just kept waiting for ashton kucher to pop out of the bathroom and tell me i got punkedi walked in for the first time ever and noticed a cash register on a display case under a giant menu so i figure that's where you order if it wasn't someone could have notified me anyway i walked up and tried to place my order while i'm ordering the woman starts getting things out of the fridge i was like uhhhh and she's all i'm listening spoiler she wasn't i ordered a chicken kabob with no lettuce or onion and asked to add cheese she didn't write a thing down or even look at me while i was talking i sit down at a table and wait about 15 minutes until my food arrives it's covered in lettuce and onion and missing cheese pretty much the exact opposite of my order i start to say something to the guy that dropped it off but he just walks away the waitress i guess at this point is buddybuddy chattty with everyone in the restaurant but me she doesn't even glance at my table before heading back into the kitchenrealizing i would have to take matters into my own hands i went up to the guy same one who delivered the food and who was standing there when i ordered told him my order was wrong and asked for a plate for the unwanted lettuce at this point you would think he would have offered to correct the order i gave him an opening i was being nice the ball was in his court but no he gave me an f'ing plate seriously dude thanks jackassi'm thinking at some point the waitress will notice the heaping plate of lettuce and realize the order was wrong she never even made another appearance by the time i got all the crap filler lettuce off there were like 5 slivers of tomato that's precisely why i skip the lettuce plus i hate iceberg with a burning passion it's like eating confetti and has no nutritional value i finish and wait with my empty plate and lettuce plate in front of me for like 5 minutes before i just walk up to the register and tell the guy i want to pay fast forward 15 minutes i'm at the bar at the pageant thank god i wasn't far and go to buy a beer no credit card i dump the contents of my purse on the bar rummage through all my pockets look in every nook and cranny but nada heart thumping i race back across the street and asked the guy if he might have forgotten to return my credit card he's looks around and is like oh look at that guess so umm did you not think it strange that you were left with a card i clearly wasn't running a tab he was 100 obliviousthe whole experience was just beyond unbelievable it made me want to clutch my pearls and declare well i never over and over again i will be slightly generous and contend that maybe it was an off night although others got  good service but i won't be back to find out there's too many other good places to get my greek fix ps they do take credit cards just make sure you get it back,negative
Cjwb7VQGP0u2eWYj1wnO3g,awful never going back as soon as we walked in we came out and they would not refund us the cover but horrible service environment we saw people getting into a fight good thing we had just left the place all the security people came it did not feel like a safe place i do not recommend for you to try this,negative
3bxSasEFR1DSfedKPZ9YBQ,omg what is going on here  someone from corporate please come see  i honestly think we are secretly being filmed for a reality show it is friday 622 630pm  the restaurant is semifilled with people all waiting for their food  everyone is just looking at each other wondering what is going on and then someone is bringing out one plate at a time and immediately the lucky patron gets up and brings their plate back to the counter because something is wrong with it it's pretty comical not  sadly this is my first  and likely last visit to zoës wish i could post a video for y'all to witness this   not sure if there's a manager at this location but someone should explain to the customers what's happening  better send some people back to training customers about to riot here  went up to finally get our food  was just sitting behind the counter  cold  they said they were waiting for one more if the items before i bringing it to us the chicken pieces must be a few days old  couldn't even cut it up dry and cold  pretty amazing bad night i guess asked friends and said that's unusual and to give it another try may do that and will hopefully have a better experience,negative
jF9F8YegOx_VMyrc9GN3xw,honestly not much going for this place overpriced and underwhelming the service from the start was not what i expected let alone the quality of food went for breakfast and now 12 hours later my self and my 4 friends are all sick would not recommend,negative
wFFHt-ixlw_3kZ6kfioMMA,have been here numerous time and used to love it  however after my most recent experience i will never come here again  went with a group of 5 people and the food was good as usual  got the bill 148 and paid with a card  we then left 30 as a tip in cash and sat outside to have a few drinks  about 5 minutes later the waitress came out and rudely asked if everything was ok with our meal because we didn't leave  a tip  wtf  i said yes i left 30 in cash  rudely she asked are you sure  i went back inside to help look around the table to see if it had fallen which isn't even possible because i put the cash with the bill that she was holding  the manager then came over and i explained to her as well that i left 30 in cash and clearly somebody took the cash in between when we left and when our server came to pick it up  she said sir my people don't do that  the waitress also said she was the only one around the table  that was a flat our lie because she wasn't even in the room when we left  the manager also accused me of not leaving a tip and in a condescending tone said it's ok we'll take care of her these things happen  by these things happen implying people not leaving a tip  i made the point that would we have stayed for additional drinks and then came in to defend myself if i hadn't left a tip  no we would have been gone immediatelyit was a very frustrating experience and not the way to treat a customer  for the waitress to come and ask that question in the first place was odd  and for the manager to also accuse me was very frustrating  i had been a frequent customer and always tip well wherever i go  to be treated that way and to basically be told to hit the road was unfortunatei will never be coming to this pretentious restaurant again,negative
ruE_DRE6fTIE6who59hdfQ,this restaurant used to be good now it's the mcdonald's of greek cuisine but whatever taste is a matter of opinion the food isn't the reason acropolis is getting a bad review they are getting a bad review because of a disgruntled employee working the bar her name is rachel allegedly if it's a fake name she's blonde with a heavily tattooed arm i came in to place an order to go and was greeted with what do you want very professional then i sat at the bar for my order to come she told me she's too busy to get me a drink and that i might want to sit at a table right like i'm gonna order a drink now i waited nearly a half hour for a gyro then she nearly throws the bag at me to get me on my way not once did i raise my voice to this lunatic or use profanity garbage bartender garbage restaurant,negative
8V9G6dC9sLCGp1LQVrmXwA,i would love to give this place a negative star but that option is not available we went to have dinner and was told to 'enjoy our visit' but it was anything but enjoyable each server pranced around us like show horses serving everyone and ignoring our table we sat and watched as others came in and got seated and received services we got up and left and the server told us that she was sorry and wanted us to come and sit after we waited for 30 minutes while her apology seemed sincere i couldn't imagine going and sitting to wait for the same i should have asked someone at one of the other tables to sample their food since we clearly was not going to be served word of advice if you are going to eat here find out who your server is before being seated because you will not be eating or drinking anything,negative
UgXqPDWEMtPaptUZ_KsSOw,my family and i went to this restaurant since were visiting from colorado and my sister in law from ohiomy parents brag how good the food is herei'm so disappointed on the service we received the restaurant was not even packedfirst we sat for 40 min with no acknowledgement my sister in law got up and got us menusthe waitress noticed she quickly came and took our drink order another 15 min pass she brought us our drinks our first cup of water tasted like mop water disgusting thankfully we had bottle water with usthen they brought us salads mmm we could not eat our salads right away because we didn't have utensilswe had to tell them we didn't have utensils she proceeded to bring us 1 fork per person with no napkins and no knifethe food took another 45 min to come outmy fish sandwich was nothing better gorton's fish stickyou would think being by the water they would have fresh fish or some type of marinade for their fishthe waitress only refilled a couple of drinks after the girls asked for it meanwhile we all needed refillswe had to ask for refills she wouldn't check on us everything we got we had to ask forthe service was beyond terrible with empty tableswe were imposed a 18 gratuity which we did not want to pay and even with us complaining they charged us and didn't even apologizedto make matters worst when we went to pay by the register there was a waitress behind th counter spraying on perfume 3 times by the food counter now i know why the water tasted like mop waterwe tried to complaint and instead of getting an apology what we got was excused to justify their bad service saying they were busy and this was their busiest seasonreally how can it have been so busy when the whole right side of the restaurant was emptymy parents have decided not to come here anymore and to all my colorado friends and ohio bewarewe will never visit this restaurant againmanagement suck and so did they're staff and food,negative
Ql5icyL9DGN9qn1-tUaN-g,horrible experience  have dined  loved the ybor location for years  with their recent dirty dinning reviews thought we'd try the kennedy location  what a huge mistake  we ordered the chicken kabobs with onions peppers side of mediterranean rice and small greek salad  the chicken  rice was served first it looked dry over cooked and the rice had been scrapped from the bottom of the pan after speaking with a server they brought  raw onions  peppers  acropolis only wanted to comp 15 of the check for this horrible display of the newly offered chicken kabob dish  it was explained to us that corporate is changing the presentation but haven't updated the menus yet  hey corporate   maybe you should at least have servers mention to their patrons the kabobs are not going to be served as they are described on the menu  this was one of the worst experiences,negative
1y3y_ihpO6SHxK9MRdtSlw,i hate for the first review of this newly renamed place to be crummy but it is what it is twice in the past few weeks i've wound up here because it's close to the train station and seemingly quick twice i've had to pick out the falafel from my meal because it was so gross leaving me with feta or whatever other sides i ordered as a vegetarian i'm used to scrounging at times but this isn't one i'm cool with toleratingplus the service was slow and the woman who made my meal was either very new or clueless,negative
I2ISRV7IybkMc3HEYKUE9g,after hesitating to contribute to yelp on many occassions my experience at audrey claire pushed me to bite the bullet  i have lived and dined in philly for over four years and every year i go back wanting to like this place but sadly i do not  the location is great the menu always sounds delectable but it's not good  i ordered the beets pumpkin and goat cheese which are all favorites of mine but it was gross particularly the beets  the pumpkin and goat cheese were okay but the beets tasted canned and were bland bland bland  additionaly i am not hard of hearing nor was my dinner date and we both heard the waiter say the special was flank steak  when my main course arrived we realized it was ny strip steak  whatever i ate it but when the host came to ask how things were going i told him just a heads up that the waiter told us flankskirt steak  he got really combative i was tired and said whatever don't care enough  when he came back i rementioned that we were certain between us that the waiter was mistaken and he just went on that they never had skirt steak on the menu we must've misheard on and on    i simply said i am the paying customer not looking for any favors just letting you know don't worry i won't be back  his response good  i pride myself in being polite to servers staff etc  i was a waitress host and bartender  his response was way out of line and in lastly i felt they were rushing our meal to get the next heard seated  third time was not a charm for me  i give up  i will never go back,negative
-9w_8PChjtA42yGN4yoDRw,horrible owner bad customer servicemy father got a waffle my wife got a feta omelet with spinach and i got biscuits and gravy you with an egg and hash browns our whole order was cold the waitress explaind that it was very busy and they had problems with other customers that day they returned my biscuits and gravy only to throw it in the microwave which turn the biscuits to a pasty mush my eggs were undercooked and they threw those in the microwave as well to finish cooking them and still came back undercooked my wife did not want to make a scene since we were having lunch with my father from outofstate i went and told the owners our problems and he explained that their quality goes down when they get busy and cant get out hot food being in the restaurant industry i am very hesitant to ever complain about food i explained him that a restaurant is supposed to have consistently hot food no matter whether there's one or thousand people in line the owner proceeded to tell me i was pretty much out of luck he would not recook our food nor would he return our money   if you didn't pay for your food upfront and paid after you were done dining i wonder if he would care little more i never write reviews but the cold food and unsympatheticowner who didn't care because he already had our money was enough for me to write,negative
LGYIhGqbYakMMdsn_GCzJg,this place is absolutely disgusting being from kc all you hear about is stls toasted raviolis it was a toss up between her  mamas this place had better reviews so we came here about 11 on a friday morning ordered the ravioli it was gross we literally had to cover the ravioli in sauce to swallow it they were dry  bland definitely not the hype that i hear abouti ordered a grilled chicken sandwich didn't know you could mess up chicken but they overdo seasoning there's so much seasoning that it makes it nasty didn't hour mom every teach you less is more my friend ordered a chicken alfredo not on menu  was called something different but complained of the same thing yuckwe both took like 23 bites and was done our waitress was pretty scripted she came over and said looks like everything was really good how would you like to pay sissssss i took 2 bites,negative

kGl2zBnLWTUBQLFkd0u_FQ,i have visited this location over the years and have thought the food was fresh   on the other hand the service has never been exceptional  tonight's service was beyond my comprehension   we called ahead around 545pm while we were driving to run in and grab the food and run home  eat and go to a meeting   after waiting on the phone for ten minutes someone finally picked us up from hold and attempted to take our four orders  the person taking the order did not even know the menu   when we asked for 4 greek chopped salads we were told they didn't have chopped greek  salads even though they are on the menu   after 3 attempts we told the order taker we would be there in ten seconds and we would give our order face to face  that process did not help   the next order taker the manager also did not know what was on the menu and had to go thru a number of gyrations before our 4 orders were entered into their pos system   we then waited 35 minutes for our four salads while we watched five other tables that came in after us receive their orders  from the time we first called in to the time we walked out the door with our food  was more than 45 minutes   i could have prepared the same salads at home fasterto add insult to injury one of  our  salads was suppose to include gyro meat which we were charged for but no meat was to be found on any of the salads when we got home at 9 pm we went back to raise the issue of no gyro meat which we had paid for   the first response from the manager was to ask one of the line cooks to get some gyro meat   three hours later i had not interest in gyro meat i just wanted to have a refund for something i paid for but did not receive   all the manager needed to do was to ask what she could do to make things better instead of throwing out ideas and hoping one would stick   in the end what every customer wants is to be heard   the manager at this location did not demonstrate any active listening skills in the process of ameliorating the situation,negative
04UD14gamNjLY0IDYVhHJg,how on god's green earth to people think this place is good okay so i'm critical of food but i know good food and as a former service industry employee i would never send food back complain about service or tip less that 20and i didn'tbut i wish i didso allow me to be a little passive aggressive via yelpmy bf and i checked out dmitri's on the stellar recommendation of my trusted foodie exroomie upon arrival we were seated quickly despite a seemingly long wait potential the decor was cozy with an open kitchen and brick walls upon realizing it was a byob i snuck away to grab a bottle of good beer from the foodery nearby apparently the whole 20 min i was gone a server hasn't approached my bf oncethis after i told the hostess on the way out that i'd be back and he would like to order while i was gone so the service was consistently bad the server took exceedingly long to check in on us if at all maybe of the two hours we were there she checked in thrice we were never told the specials and she didn't sound at all enthused in the food probably with good reason because it suckedi hate to say it because we heard such good things but service aside dmitri's was an overall disappointment the baba was decent but that and the cucumber tatziki was completely under salted the grilled octopus that followed tasted very syscodouble refrozen and fishy with a gritty and chewy textures and far too much vinegar as a tenderizer we didn't eat more than 2 bites of it thinking it was rancid and could cause food poisoningnext was the plum tomato pasta and seafood combination essentially a mish mosh of notsofresh seafood over cooked to rubberization in tomato juice it was okay the pasta was way overcooked and not at all seasoned how does this happen at a food establishment the sauce looked like it was made with canned tomatoes and a few shreds of basiland nothing else again we barely had two bites of it our server had cleared our app plates and never brought us new silverware or plates we picked at the food before packing it up and heading home i doubt we'll eat the leftovers i mean you can't really reheat overcooked spaghetti the only saving graces were the decor and the sweet couple never to us that sparked up conversation sadly we won't be back to dmitri's as we both left craving anything but that like seriously would have rather had mcdonald'sew and that's sacrilegious to say as a foodiemaybe you guys will have better experiences but we won't waste our time money and tastebuds again,negative
XxJNkRNigimV8nuLfW1TZg,the food is good very good actually but delivery is horrible we ordered twice and one time it came so cold i had to put it in my own oven to heat it up and this time it never came at all canceled the order if you can pick it up great but cold and late over an hour without any warning when we ordered on a wednesday night just is a nonstarter we well never order for delivery from there again scrambled eggs for dinner tonight get your act together guys,negative

mY4i1N0Hm2fjIgU0Eyn11Q,i've been dining here for years but a recent horrible experience has all but ensured that i'll never be back  on a beautiful friday night we called for an outside patio reservation we were told no problem but when arrived the patio was under construction we were seated in the midst of dust and were shocked when someone began using a tile cutter next to the patio we could not even hear each other over the noise  in between the power tools the tile man was banging in tiles mere feet from our table  the food was subpar and that's being generous service was not good but the disrespect shown to diners was unforgivable,negative
Tyub4uN0yku6wyS1JWMejA,ordered and waited a long time for the food then   the customers who ordered after me got their food first and walked out happily the lady cooking had a bad attitude and when she gave me my order she repeated it to me informing me the whole order was in the bag i got my food so i was content and drove home 16min north upon coming home we noticed the foil was not a wrap we ordered we had only gotten half of the order i called the restaurant to see if there was a delivery option since i just drove back and the owner said to me that the lady didn't know which order the wrap belonged too and that i should have checked the order before leaving as if it was my fault i didn't get my order correct i asked for refund and he ignored my request in times like these where most restaurants are offering delivery and curbside this place doesn't care the least about making their customers happy i spent 21 on one meal today and the meal that i did order was supposed be a chicken kabob the picture speaks for itself will be going to suri's from now on,negative
OgUrojj-vHiX51ra4A8uqg,no thrills eatery selfordering place claiming being greek bur the food is a caricature of greek cuisine  gyro without gyro equipment bland and tastless what is worse it was barely warmed up the souflaki and rice only visually ressambled greek food the kitchen is managed by  three young girls who look like that just came from  starbucks in sum i don not  recommend this,negative
ncwW7rgpLEfoR44IwAsOVQ,i have enjoyed many special occasions at remy's and it has been one of my go to places in clayton  unfortunately the dining experience there has been steadily declining over the past year  despite new items on the menu it really has not changed much and has gotten boring predictable  the service was disappointing and underwhelming we waited 10 minutes after being seated until a server came to our table and that was only after i spoke to the hostess the owner lisa slay was standing next to the hostess and saiddid nothing the food was tasty but not exciting and the large plate portions are small  the server forgot about the substitution i had requested so that my meal had to be returned to the kitchen  the next time i feel like going to remy's i will resist there are too many good restaurants in clayton with better food and hospitality who make it clear that they appreciate our business,negative

c21fgdWZTPmyC_z0cEMDnw,when i saw that a simple greek franchise was opening up in the area i was looking forward to giving it a try  as a fan of the tv show the profit i was aware of their approach to food  it is assembled to order with a variety of greek style foods condiments sides and seasonings  a welcomed alternative to burgers and mexican fareafter going there several times the last two times have been very disappointing  the food sits in warmers before being moved to chafing dishes where the meal is assembled  this makes the food ok but not great or even very goodduring one visit i ordered my food and a fountain drink  the diet pepsi was depleted and i mentioned it to the cashier  she said okay but did nothing else i asked if she was going to address it and she replied that she did not know how  i suggested that she tell someone at which point she went to get her manager  the manager said that they were out of diet pepsi and i asked to have my money refunded  the manager refunded the money to my credit card and then asked to keep the refund receipt rather than give it to me wanting to leave me without any record of the refundtoday i decided to give them another chance  i ordered my food which included fries  it was not until after i paid that they told me that the fries were not ready and that i would have to wait  at this point they said that they would be ready shortly  i stood there waiting for the fries and was told that she would bring them to me  i asked how long and she said two minutesas i ate my meal i noticed that there were other people walking away from the cashier with their meals which included fries these people had entered the restaurant after i had ordered my fries  as i was completing my meal the cashier brought fries to me  i told her that i wanted them with my meal and no longer wanted them  she sent the manager over who refunded the cost of the fries even giving me a refund receiptas much as i want to frequent the simple greek i don't think it will be happening,negative
aRxFcyKUGgbzKlkT2GoHTw,a place that gets over crowded late at night that serves about average pizza  my new york style cheese slice was burnt on the bottom which is not the be all end all  they took over a place that had excellent ny style slices  delfinos also offers subs wings and other appetizer type foods  even though they offer delivery the area is very limited as far as the service it was nothing to write home about was impressed but was not insulted,negative

A8iy-bV6taBloWc-1PfSKQ,the worst gyro i have ever had gyros does not have lettuce on them the cucumber sauce was like salad dressing the pita was stuffed not flat with the meat and condiments on top the meat was tasteless and not off a spit i'm going to post pictures of a real chicago style gyros and the crap they gave me being from chicago this place is a disgrace to the chicago name the place was a dive,negative
Cjwb7VQGP0u2eWYj1wnO3g,can't find the option to rate it below 0 stars if there was one i'd select that in a heartbeat service was horrible waited one hour for fries and if that wasn't enough it came with a side of human hair where's the health inspector when you need one,negative
YDq4238PuPkYhiLkdAZhKQ,if i could give this place a half star i would and i didn't even eat at the restaurant  we're new to the area and have a great love of greek food  as such we googled greek food in west chester and this was the first hit  with it's 4 star rating we felt pretty safe in ordering  when i went to pick up the order the young man acting as host literally walked right past me to serve a couple who walked in after me  he literally didn't even look at me  i assume that these were regular customers or something and patiently waited for him to return to service me  however this wasn't the case  the young man continued on to the kitchen and didn't return until a second couple was coming in the the dinning room at which point i practically had to step into him to get him to see me  i'm not sure how he missed me as i am a 6'3 man and i was wearing a red shirt  unfortunately this isn't the end of the bad service  i was lead to the entry way of the kitchen where i was asked to stand awkwardly and obstructively in the entry as one of the wait staff yelled at her coworkers trying to find out who it was that packed my order  i'm not sure why she could look up the price to my order and not the order itself to verify what's on the table but apparently this is the case for mythos  at this point in my mind if the food is good i'm still willing to give this place up to 4 stars  everyone has their off night after allso off i go with my 2 bags of food  when we get home we find a soggy mess instead of fried zucchini and as a previous poster said the salad dressing for our salad was simply red wine vinegar with a few chunks of feta that had settled to the bottom  other than the zucchini we ordered 2 gyro platters thinking that these would be the simplest things on the menu but apparently at this place it's terribly complex  the food was warm at best and terribly bland  they gyro meat was not fresh and i doubt it was made in house  all the slices were completely uniform in size and shape and had the look of pressed meat patties the lemon baked potatoes tasted like they'd simply boiled some potatoes and sprinkled a bit of bottled lemon juice on them and the spanakorizo was simply rice  yesno spinach to be seen  just rice  i'll grant if this was some cheap place i would likely be a lot more forgiving of the food quality but at 42 i expect quite a bit higher quality,negative
c3a5La0D2L51qXVE7DIJLg,we got lost several times attempting to locate spice end i was determined to find the restaurant however and was glad to find that it was worth the trek the menu was extensive providing me with many vegetarian options to choose from the service was good and the prices were decent what made spice end truly great though was the foodafter lengthy deliberation i ordered samosa chaat which i have never before tried it was wonderful the portion was slightly larger than i was able to eat but it was so delicious that i ate more than i might otherwise have the samosas came swimming in a spicy sauce with tender chickpeas the sauce was not hot temperature wise which was a refreshing complement to the samosas the samosas themselves were hot almost painfully so i couldn't quite tell if it was temperaturewise or spicewise or most likely both they were crisp even as they sat in a pool of sauce the sauce as well as the samosa filling was quite flavorful from the cool smooth sauce to the tender chickpeas to the crisp and cream of the samosas to the light crunch of the garnish the entire dish was a beautiful marriage of textures flavors and temperatures if ever i should return to philadelphia i will definitely dine at spice end again i was most pleased with this restaurant,positive

NDzQFHW671hbB-aArOy12A,i was in indianapolis on a biz trip when i found myself with some extra time before my flight home i was craving pakistani food but was unsure of the options indy would provide but my instincts ie my stomach led me to lafayette rd to check out chapati the place is colorful well decorated and spacious as soon as i walked in i was warmly greeted by a nice young gentleman at the front he explained the menu's organization and answered my questions about how each dish was cooked what really piqued my interest was knowing that the chicken boti is marinated and then cooked in a rotisserie which locks in the juicy flavor vs a tandoor which has more of a smoky flavor and can be dry if cooked too long i was sold chicken boti it is they also happily substituted rice for a salad the food came out pretty quick and it did not disappoint the chicken boti had immense flavor and was super tenderi'm talking melt in your mouth tender the salad had a hint of paki  indo flair to it with the mint yogurt sauce and crunchy chaat toppingsnice touch food was most definitely on point only critique i have about the experience is the chapati was a tad dry maybe rubbing some butter on it before serving it would take care of that you know i also had to try the falooda so much for substituting rice for salad right and it was refreshing and extremely satisfying this was a perfect way to top off a productive trip to hoosier state whenever i make it back to indy the first stop i'll make is to chapati to try out the rest of the menu and school some fools in carrom board,positive

ngvE1G9IckUO-ljZBFo23w,i was walking home in the cold of night when i suddenly had the craving for hot delicious samosas i yelped around for a bit and found this place which was nearby even though i popped in fifteen minutes before closing they served me my heart's desire hot and fresh samosas and i didn't intend to but the prices were so inexpensive that i ended up ordering a meal and chai along with iti had gobi masala with garlic naan and mint chutney the mint chutney was not as savory as i would've liked and i prefer it room temperature rather than cold but these aren't really things to argue abouti came again with my grandma and ordered the vegetables malai kofta and was similarly impressed i want to try the buffet next the impression i'm given is that while their food is pretty good excellent even considering the price range and neighborhood their samosas are the real kings of the menu to me a great goto,positive

8crVeVL3pi8OFRj9c_3vxQ,my daughter and i had dinner here a few days ago  we ordered the calamari appetizer special it was so so but the main entrees were excellent i had the evil jungle princess boldly spiced chicken sauted with vegetable medley exotic spices and herbs which i asked to be made very hot my daughter had the chicken vindaloo cubes of chicken and potatoes cooked in spicy sauce again both were excellent and portion size was good we also had two orders of garlic naan overall very good food in a pleasant environment and good service,positive
6_LnAQQ0-mml8YgpfRjGuA,i've only had the chicken sandwich in pita bread here but that's enough to make me want to come back and try other items on the menu it's a pretty big portion and everything is cooked to order plenty of juicy chicken fresh vegetables and just the right amount of their sauce don't expect a fancy restaurant there are signs that says no cell phones i was thrown off at that but i guess it's a great idea  i was able to enjoy my food and have a conversation instead of browsing on social media napkins utensils bags and to go boxes are located in the dining area for your convenience overall great place to grab a bite sucks they're closed on sundays,positive
foFpx3znhLJvnplex8aqww,i rarely eat indian food since curries can sometimes go south on mebut wanted to try something different with a date it was a wonderful experience the server politely explained different menu items graciously repeating through his mask and helped us to try a variety of new things the service was attentive even through social distancing and a constant line of folks for takeout food was very tasty too best tandori ever will be back,positive

h8jPi55Rom8-bu6POXvMCQ,we recently gave philly this restaurant but they continue to impress at the original location one of my favorite places to go during restaurant week if you like indian or if you're just interested in something differentthis is without a doubt one of the best restaurants in the areait's byob and a little bit a fusion if the weathers great eat outside and enjoy the night,positive

GW-H37yWCNhgWPg9RwKbVA,i ordered everything the waiter suggested i can't remember any names but it was good and plenty,positive

aIflpZXlmofFGelTlqgGEQ,i was not feeling well the other day and needed a hot bowl of soup which led me to this place i ordered the egg drop soup on uber eats along with ku chow chicken and burnt garlic rice it was outstanding the spice and flavor of the chicken was something i have never tasted before in the best way the garlic rice was the garlickiest flavor i have ever encounteredalso in the best way i actually saved some of both and flew home with it for my husband to try he was blown away sadly my extra soup was taken by tsa  i would definitely check this place out again next time i visit nashvillehere's to hoping they oozes one in ft lauderdale,positive

p1R63C5BpV2rOurtC4fgdg,the food is made to order and isn't americanized i'm glad i finally tried it the owners are pleasant and professional keep in mind that the establishment is providing fresh food concerning wait times even with that the time to wait is reasonable and you can always order online or call it in i've enjoyed going down the menu and having old favorites i'll add pictures the next time i order try them i'm almost certain you won't be disappointed,positive

VpJzlz3bKOJtiI1rb9kTpw,my friend and i met at saffron on an early friday evening to have dinner  the place was near empty expected since we were eating like senior citizens and we were warmly greeted by the host  we took our seats in the booth  i ordered a glass of wine why not and we perused the menu  we split the navaratan korma kadhai chicken and the assorted bread basket  it was a ton of food and delcious leftovers but we wanted to have plenty to try this being only my 3rd indian food experiencei was very pleased with saffron  the food was fantastic  very flavorful and just the right amount of heat we got mild because i'm a wimp  i think unless we really want to continue exploring we'll definitely returnthe staff was very attentive though almost creeply so at a couple pointsdo not be fooled by this unassuming strip mall location  the food is worth the visit,positive
qzbbpQ14j_C0u0KtKQL7VQ,walking by to get thai food  this place smelled so good we went here instead of getting thai food  food was reasonably priced  the food was outstanding  i asked for more tikka sauce and the waiter got it for me even though he wasn't supposed to  i'm used to getting my indian food in scotland and this place is on par with those establishments in the uk  very authentic food service was outstanding  the only thing that needs work is the ambiance  overall i'd recommend this place,positive

INWHqjudS0vDcVKlHyz69A,a great delco option  went on a sunday at noon sat right down had a drink and my first plate of food within 5 minutes  everything on the buffet was hot and fresh  service was good and you get your own basket of fresh naan instead of it being on the buffet  20 for two of us with tip i can't wait to go back and i can anytime since it is close to home and i don't have to fight for parking downtown,positive

TbjqvdrSBm27arbKbReRfg,i set out this evening to check in on the festivities at the parkway soirée at the swan memorial fountain the weather was a bit chilly for outdoor dinning so i strolled down 20th and stumbled upon thanal not knowing what to expect i called in reinforcements and invited a friend to join me she loves indian food so i figured this was a good enough incentive the vibe here is nuevoindian cusine clean well appointed and perfectly lighted not too dark and not too bright the acoustics are such that you can carry on a conversation across your table and actually hear the other person without straining nor is the din of the surroundings overbearing wherin you need a bull horn to be heard forgive me if it took till the third paragraph to get to the best part the food here is nothing short of amazing i'm a vegan so dinning out unless it's at a vegan eatery is often problematic not herethe staff was highly attentive knowledgable and professional our server cynthia was top notch and brought the entire experience over the top everything we ate was fresh authentic and outdtanding even my manhatten wad made to perfection this place is an absolute find,positive

yktnwboMIQZkOvcZywktzA,great atmosphere excellent price for the amount of food and the quality of food tried the lamb rogan josh and lamb mango both excellent dishes tho the mango should be more for springsummer because of the lighter curry and the rogan josh is good for winter because it has a heavier curry flavor lamb was so delicious however it was inconsistently cut so the larger pieces weren't as tender as the smaller cuts bathrooms could use a little update but overall really great indian food,positive
ws6TIgXXA-5RSHRrMBEktA,new favorite indian place we moved here recently and have already been and ordered from curry leaf a bunch of times their food is always fresh and tastes wonderful i'm mostly vegetarian and the selection is perfect samosas are great maligatawny soup is not too spicy but a delicious blend of spices and flavors so good love  the paneer tikka and navratan korma and they're generous with the rice for takeout which is a mustwe've seen their lunch buffet and haven't had a chance to try but it looks like a great assortment for the ,positive

KbhKbjG7fVM2vTtO3qbe0w,wow talk about a food coma  first off the atmosphere is to die for  it really does add to the dining experience  the cocktails are top notch we ordered a few different ones but our favorite was 'resting beach face' it was the perfect mix of refreshing with a little kick  the food was so delicious  we ordered a big variety so we could get the full experience  we started off with the 'most apeeling snack' which is plaintain chips with an indian spice blend great starter to snack on with cocktails  then we had the samosa chaat and pork belly hot appetizers  for our main dish we split 'the og' which was amazing  just a classic indian dish with tons of flavor  we added the brussels on the side and the flatbread similar to naan to soke up the delicious sauce  it was a ton of food and we definitely had leftovers the food comes out as it is ready so if you want a more paced meal i would suggest ordering as you finish each course so you don't end up with a table full of food,positive

jwp7_9S5IslgXnA7udfkYQ,i really do like this place even for the faults the food is delicious but the last 2 times i have ordered in here my order has been partly wrong the first time they forgot an appetizer the second time regular naan instead of garlic naan both were easily corrected and the food quality is delicious enough to overlook those issues the paneer 65 is deliciously spicy with that great red sauce the lamb saag i ordered at a spice level 10 and it delivered deliciously spiced with big chunks of lamb and you can taste the layers of flavor i'll be back again and maybe that time we can get my order right the 1st time,positive
X6GzniQjbm3YFWWwzDrBkg,such a pleasant experience the service was top notch the food was delicious and the experience was so authentic  this was the first time i've tried indian food and i couldn't have chose a better spot to try it the butter chicken was soo tender and good the curry lamb was even better i loved how personable the staff were they ensured our glasses were filled and when our basmati rice was low they came with a new plate covid rules were enforced and i'll def be back,positive
h8jPi55Rom8-bu6POXvMCQ,a bit pricey but great if you go to during the happy hours i love the fact that they ahve that early but also very late as well as an option and for that reason is my favorite placeplease get the samosas i have never had a place that serves them as well as here with chickpeas you make make a meal of all their appetizers  we tried at least 10 of the appetizers 2 people,positive

dPiPtXLtbaiPdHMcRXrGpg,i don't know how i can eat out as much as i do and not weigh 900 pounds  especially when i regularly feast on the navratan korma from bhagaya's kitchen i can justify it because it's got veggies in it but who am i kidding the sauce is all creamwhich makes it so crazy delicious and also why i can eat almost an entire pint of it with rice by myselfand since i'm being so honest with you guys i would be remiss if i l didn't tell you about their chicken tikka masala and chana masala because i scarf that down too with naan and sometimes a veggie samosa wowzayep i'm a hungry girl all right the prices are a bit steep to come here every day which is probably a good thing for me and since it's takeout the food needs to be heated up at home which to me is cooking yeahi don't really do that but who am i kidding  this place is awesome even if i have to use actual kitchen appliances to eat my dinner,positive
ekqczYiPx-RbfhT7Epbu2Q,i got half four alarm and half samosa the samosa is tasty though i think the cheese didn't belong four alarm is a good clean burn sauce and crust are quite good no atmosphere to speak of would be ideal for take out wish they opened earlier sundays for game day will be back to try more of the unusual menu,positive
6b-ySr3Jn6rQ20DD5AtqFw,bindi has been on my list of places to check out well since it opened thanks to the relative emptiness of the city on the weekends now that everyone else is at the shore my party of three was seated right away around 730pm on a saturday night  once seated we screwed the cap off our wine and ordered a few starters the lobster pani puri and the sweet goat cheese paratha for entrees two of us couldn't resist the mahi and our third ordered the chicken tikka suffice it to say this was the best meal i've had in a very long time i'm so used to dining on indian food that is burdened with heavy overpowering sauces but each dish here was light and flavorful  allowing you to taste each element yet delicately blending together with distinctly indian spices and preparation the lobster pani puri set the stage for the rest of the meal with crispy little puff balls hiding sweet nuggets of lobster that had us practically fighting over the last bite the goat cheese paratha offered a precise blend of sweet and savory and complimented our spicier entrees very well glad we went with the waitress' recommendation here the mahi delighted the entire table and the chicken tikka was the best incarnation of that dish i've experienced this review has now taken much longer to write than it should have because i keep drifting off  reliving last night's meal in my head  and i snap back to finding myself very close to drooling on my keyboard classy decor and an attentive staff rounded out the experience the dining room is about the size you would expect from a center city byo  room for a large group or two but best suited for groups of four or less bindi is cash only and make sure you overestimate how much you'll spend i thought the price point was fair  but once you start eating you'll want to order everything on the menu,positive
7L0WAmZ0fP5hKzdhVAkIhQ,so glad we finally went food was delicious everything from the appetizer to a small complimentary desert they give you at the end their spicy foods are not too spicy and the sauces are amazing will definitely be returning expect a small wait it's totally worth it,positive

DTv2J5HBWEdIm9NSwsiFbQ,some of the best indian food in the area  great lunch buffet and they offer a delicious goat curry which i love along with many traditional dishes like chicken tikka masala saag paneer veg korma asian fusion diish rice salad soup 4 desserts fresh naan delivered to your table and tasty chaithere dinner service is even better because you can order the food indian spicy and they do a very nice job catering to both indian and american clients  this is not an easy accomplishment  the mixed tandoori platter extra spicy was tender on the inside and a nice char on the outside  meat was moist and full of flavor with the right amount of heat  lamb roganjosh was also spot on and highly recommend  the manchurian was tasty but was also a little oily bread basket was excellentthis is a byob but there is a pizza shop you can walk to and get a 6 pack of beer,positive
9qibROTHxJMFun7Y_FUdKA,i'm new to nepali food though i love indian food which i hear is somewhat similar this place is definitely frequented by napoli people coming in saturday it was at first intimidating since my husband and i were not nepali though we sat at the bar and we were quickly attended to the staff were very friendly and helpful with our understanding the menu we explained it was our first time and they described dishes and made some suggestions the food came out fairly quickly and was extremely flavorful and of high quality so much so that i returned sunday very pleased by this restaurant they are very friendly to people who are not familiar with the cuisine and then once it comes to you you will be quite pleased by the quality and flavorfulness will be back and probably this week great place for vegans and vegetarians since there are so many options,positive
IBe1ubALseL7MoHo2tT7VQ,best indian food in nashville authentic atmosphere and wonderful service there's never a long wait and food comes out hot and fresh i recommend the garlic naan and chicken curry,positive
xkS_mRHVHuX0ko6kVIyBdA,i'm speechless this place is 1010 this was my first time trying masala spice and i was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful everything i ordered was the gobi manchurian was amazing i would say it is a must order,positive
9dL1rsPANYr-71hdwoY-CA,they used to be a pretty good indian restaurant but not sure what happened but last nights dinner was simply terrible poor slow service and worst indian food i have ever eaten over salted but otherwise lacking in the usual bouquet of indian spices samosas were overly thick and doughy pakoras were greasy lamb rohan josh was a thick gooey tasteless mess best bet walk on by and find another place,negative
KUxeF9WDiPZZguBEwwonbw,ok i am comparing this to the wonderful indian restaurants back home in ca as i have done with the other two local indian places here  this one i will not go back to and it has very little to do with the lack number of dishes offeredi tried the lunch buffet today 1150 and it was so not worth it  rice three veg options and two chicken options and some kind of soup were the hot offerings  oh and the pakoras as well  there was a mixed veggie salad onions carrots didn't really look iike it belonged oranges watermelon dessert and three sauces tamarind chutney cilantro chutney mixed pickle and raita  the cilantro chutney was nice and spicy but hella runny  the tamarind chutney was very blah and the raita was very peppery and very thinwatery as well  indian food is supposed to be rich and creamy and none of the veggie dishes had this quality  the channa masala one of my fave indian dishes just tasted buttery  the pakoras were set on a table in a cloth napkin no way to really keep them warm  their cardinal sin though was the naan  it was definitely not made in a tandoor and sadly it looked like it could have come out of a package at the supermarket  i took the take out menu out of kindness but it is sitting next to me and will hit the recycling bin in a moment  my advice  hit up magazine street for nirvana or taj mahal in metairie  even though they offered only a few more selections on their lunch buffet the quality of the food is much better,negative
svmLWKFTns98Z1MdCrmDig,never going back to this place if you are mixing your regular chicken gravy with rice and calling it biriyani then you are cheating people this is not authentic biriyani way too expensive for the kind of food you serve for a mango lassi and the chicken gravy rice  so called biriyani they charged me 32,negative
5EkkPPA6ZOltPFKo97H_5g,i was very worried after reading the reviews i was a bit leery coming here the sign outside says the place is san samosathe buffet is a bit run down you know how food gets a skin on top from drying out some of the descriptions were a bit sketchy too but like any buffet i pulled up a chair and sampled just about everything they don't use a lot of care in preparation as i got a few bites of cartilage in the tikka masala the veggie dishes were a bit dried outthe food was edible even the tikka tasted good if i lived in the neighborhood i probably wouldn't be a regular here,negative
Fi2aJPlbnkeVyRKErn0IBQ,hole in the wallfood was ok but online menu prices are incorrectbuffet has like 8 items and its 10ppbathroom is in the gas stationloltea is 3wtf,negative
xOr8R9oZWzKjv_29z5OOQg,first time trying food here giving it two stars because the chicken marsala was ok not the best i also got their butter chicken and it didn't really taste like butter chicken more tomato than butter i've had better butter chicken they lost a lot of stars because i ordered a side of naan for two dollars and they gave me this tiny hard dry piece of naan description read garlic and chopped cilantro do you see garlic and chopped cilantro or am i blind naan is my favorite so disappointed anyways probably wouldn't order again,negative
bKbvmpGy_L96qVtNeR_HNA,i got food poisoning from here threw up for hours about an hour after eating it for lunch i didn't even do the buffet i ordered veggies and rice from the menu i've never been so sick in my life,negative
26FBIjrkQ9SH-JPvvr0PXA,my husband i were craving indian so we made the 20 minute drive from our nashville hotel to shagor we are in tn for business and previously spotted this awkward looking restaurant on our first lets see what is around here drive  amongst the hundreds of fast food joints which sell standard fried foods finding shagor was a nice surprise  when home in boston we eat out at our fav indian joint at least 3 times a monththe building in which shagor resides in was obviously something else in its previous life you can still read drive thru and we deliver on their sign a drive thru indian restaurant now that's an ideawe did see quite a few people in there on our initial drive by but today we were solo until we were halfway through our meal it was nicely decorated on the inside with linen on the tables i also liked their plates and serving bowls yeah i knowwho cares about that right the crisp white plates looked nice on the darker linen and made for a nice tablescapeour waiter seemed young and timid and i got a sense that he was new to the job but he was very polite and attentive none the less we didn't need any help with the menu but i did overhear him having a hard time explaining a few dishes to the couple behind us complimentary papadum were hot and crispy and the chutney it was yellownot the usual onion or tamarind was spicy and had me excited for the main course we both had the mulligatawny soup as a starter mulligatawny is my favorite indian soup and i usually always order it when trying out new restaurants shagor's not 1 on my list but it is definitely not the last i enjoyed the soup and would order it againwe both ordered chicken tikka masala we should have mixed it up for the sake of tasting another dish but apparently we both craved the same thing i ordered mine hot and he very hot we both like our curry with a touch of scorch to itand sadly our ctm did not ignite anything mine was actually a little better tasting than his as his had an overpowering taste of chili powder the plain naan was delicious just the right amount of doughyness to soak up the sauceall in allshagor satisfied our indian craving but we are not sure if we'll be back not the worstbut not the best,negative
35GCFtezJ3upyqGf-zJ8MA,food was lackluster had the chicken tika marsala chicken was dry and sauce was bland even after ordering medium for 1199 i figured i would've gotten more than four little nuggets of chicken but no that was it the place was completely empty when we arrivied but more customers came in as we were eating you would think they didnt know that we were in the middle of a pandemic as they seated people in the booths on either side of us the restaurant had plenty of seating to space people out but social distancing doesn't exist here won't be coming back,negative
rB067lnTKVSiMU46z24BHg,my husband and i were in st pete for the weekend and went here because of the great reviews for their curry its tough to find good curry in texas  i was so disappointed we sat down looked at the options and was amazed lamb shank sign me up even with the 24 price tag about double the cost of the other meat options then pick a sauce awesome then add the curry set up i was starving and this was going to be good ugh what i got was ice cold lamb shank that i could not even cut and what was that sauce worst curry i have tasted and did i mention i live in texas where most curry is subpar this was bad i should have sent it back but i was with a ton of people i had just met and i didn't want to be that girl so i ate the naan bread which was fine i've heard their other food is good but with all the options here it will take awhile for me to go back next time i'm in town,negative
i3mk-jyyDvdsWGn6AtdkgA,it kills me to pan a new restaurant out of the gate but when the food is bad it's bad palak paneer was dark as tar with indescribably gross flavors and almost nauseating to eat lamb vindaloo was thinly spiced with poor quality meat gamey with many moments of mystery the dish was mostly potatoes  a respite from nearinedible meat vegetable samosas were pretty much all potato gummy sticky with a cheap pastry shell the rice and naan both flatout suckedthese are not frivilous complaints about decor weirdvestiges of the former sushi place or wait time over 30 minutes for my order with no other orders coming in during that time or any other of the totally fixable newrestaurant issues this is core fundamental stuffi can't see how ironing out the kinks could improve the ingredients or preparation i hope they can turn it around because otherwise this place doesn't have a snowball's chance in south asiatwo stars instead of one because they were supernice but nice doesn't cure bad and i can't recommend it,negative
UbdKhCldumBaCBszSNBWfg,i wouldn't even give this place one star if i was able to my husband and i went there on a thursday night not busy at all just us and another family the waiter brought out the water pitcher and cups and we asked for straws since the cups looked questionable in terms of the cleanliness he literally rolled his eyes at us and did not give us straws about five minutes later i got up and went to the front where they have the cakes and asked the other guy who by the way was on his personal cell phone talking away as i stood there waiting to be acknowledged and he ultimately gave me two straws our waiter brought out the salted lassi i had ordered slammed it on the table and threw a straw next to it needless to say the service alone would deter me from ever stepping foot in this place now for the food we ordered the vegetable hakka noodles garlic naan and vegetable korma the garlic naan was thin and there was no taste of garlic or any flavor at all the vegetable korma was average not really memorable the hakka noodles were overly salty and that's what ruined the taste not once did our waiter come by to ask us if everything was okay or if we needed anything but he surely had no problem walking around talking loudly on his phone finally we had enough and we were ready for the check he came by took our plates and leftovers and walked away we literally sat there looking around waiting for him to bring us our check for no exaggeration 18 minutes until i once again went to the guy in the front to ask him for our total so we can paywe probably would have overlooked the small things in taste and built up the courage to give this place another try however the attitude of the waiter and the rudeness by which we were treated was ridiculous with plenty of other options to choose from nearby you'd think they would get their act straight and treat the paying customers with some respect we will not be going back and will definitely be telling all our friends and families about our experience,negative
TVX2a4bVuCE2VUIkiLdZrQ,the food is good but the service is terrible i had a mediocre experience my first time there but my second was so bad that i won't return the hostess sat us at a table close to the entrance we knew it wasn't a great table but preferred not to wait once we sat we immediately felt like we were in a cold wind tunnel because the front door was kept open so i asked to be moved she said ok but instead sat 5 other parties and avoided eye contact the waiter took our order and never returned our food came out quickly so we ate quickly so we could leave quickly once the food came out we didn't want to be moved anyway but she didn't check on us or even acknowledge my request for a new table we would have been fine if got a little attention or the offer of a free desert that we may have refused but felt like they cared,negative
oinV9xrSkR3b_T8sK1nsqg,the good the menu has excellent reviews  kudos to the kitchen staff the restaurant is nicely appointed and designed the ambience trendy and fun the odds are in your favor that you will enjoy dining here howeverread more below the bad customer service does not consistently fare as well if you read through the reviews you will find that some diners felt unwelcome  horrible and deplorable were some of the stronger terms used  in 4 words we found owner a to be rude arrogant disrespectfuldishonest  and will never return as a result we are unable to give bibi ji 5 stars  but rather 5 pinnochios and an overall  customer service rating of 0 stars ,negative
YsgNELwtqulRa3l3armcLA,i would give it a 4510 just an average place for the lunch buffet only i'm going with two stars for the meh i've experienced better quote the view is the best part of the meal other than that i would say ok food i have tried it here two times and will not come back mainly because the food has been consistently too sweet andor bland the salad is drenched in dressing and wiltedsoggy they have a homemade hot sauce you can use but it is more just to make it more hotspicy not as much spicy with flavor its not that i need super spicy just some more savory flavor i think they might be trying to make it americanized too much and take out any spice from the buffet choicesi also thought it was weird that you have to pay cash to use their coupon if paying for more than one meal who requires cash on a twenty dollar total i don't want to deal with that there are a couple other indian restaurants that are amazing and close by so i wouldn't recommend this particular restaurant,negative
EKK2t4zhHZLeiBrgMv3Yyw,worst behavior ever the staff doesnt have the basic courtesy they shouted at us for being 5 mins over the close time would never ever step into this place again no good food can make up for today's rude behavior,negative
_HMrtN8oEoC4arLmVVSZmw,a big disappointment the rogenjosh was watery and ketchuplike in flavor the naan was doughy and underdone ive eaten at saffron's other locations in the past and found them ok at best if you're looking for great indian fare on the main line  try ekta in bryn mawr instead,negative
hI8FAbwX6hShUCK1xnpDhw,we went there for lunch buffet and occupied the table as advised by the server we brought food on to the table and i waited for 10 mins and no water on the table and so when we needed water i asked the server to get some water on to the table the shocking response i got is to have some patience the most rude and careless response from restaurant peopledon't even care if some body is choking and  coughing in desperate need for water instead of the delay in service the response you get is to have some patienceworst service i have faced of all the india restaurants i went todeeply disappointed and never going to come back to this place and will advise the same to all my friends,negative
-HMqisHgmwr4k8zwT3tp5Q,i had high hopes for this place given the reviews i saw on yelp i must be spoiled by seva indian cuisine in kc mo because this just didn't do it for me we went to the lunch buffet around 1pm on saturday and the place was packedso i was excited to try the food since it seemed popular the buffet had a nice variety so that vegetarians and meat lovers alike could dig in i opted for the spinach paneer chicken tikka masala lamb masala and the naan the naan was very greasy and i was sad not to see garlic naan the buffet items were okay but the overall impression was that everything was quite watery  or just mostly sauce with some bits of veggies and meat hiding somewhere within it the flavors were good but i would prefer to get a little more food for the price 25 for two people the carrot halwa for dessert was delicious perhaps we will come back some other try to give it another chance or maybe order off of the menu,negative
EBpicl13JZwCypP0NlbINA,the taste and quality do not stand up to the brand name 'paradise' paradise chain of restaurants is quiet popular for biryani i didn't like the biryani i ordered perhaps one walks in with certain expectationsi gave two stars because the thursday buffet for dinner has quiet a large number of good vegetarian options buffet is worththe service in this restaurant sucks,negative
cLP6FkJ2HSR6haTHcEGWhA,been here for an hour since we ordered  this place is so run down and poorly run this was truly their last chance for us  please close and make room for another restaurant and,negative
ZMJz4ekxrcZdhBcnK4B_6g,completely wrong order which is normally not that bad if the restaurant is willing to correct their mistake and send you a new order however they decided to blame the driver and the driver decided to blame the restaurant so we are shit out luck eating 13 of a meal that we spent over 100 on terrible service,negative
EmQQkn-kdK3bZI1cpHRQyA,the waiter was pleasant enough although he took away our partially eaten appetiser without asking if we were done with it the rice was a bit clumpy the chicken was dry the naan was thick and almost cakelike and the mango lassi was pretty mediocre the level of spiciness of the entree was about right but overall it was a pretty lame experience at least it was relatively inexpensive,negative
IBe1ubALseL7MoHo2tT7VQ,worst indian we have had in a town with below average indian options  portions were very small  38 before tip with no drinks didn't even yield leftovers  chicken was dry and tough rice was dry mattar paneer and chicken korma sauces tasted and looked about the same  avoid this place unless you are desperate,negative
2HcGpWQvTrOQu0kp5S3VIA,please avoid this place if at all possible horrible customer service i mean it is really really bad customer service for example i was looking for an item and i scanned the isle 3 times when the lady walked over there i asked her if she has the item she rudely replied without even looking at me all the time walking away quot see properly if you cant find it i cant find itquot i asked her if she has some inside quotshe gives me an angry stare and said we do not have anything insidequot and walked away i stood there shaking my head i was looking for a pressure cooker on another day and the lady was so rude that she did not even want me to see what options they had she just bought some cheap looking cooker and said this is the only one they have when clearly all other brands were stocked and displayed for everyone to see i asked her what the other boxes were and she gets angry and says this is a better brand took her 15 mins to figure out the price a ridiculous 60 or 65 for a 2 litre for an unbranded piece of trashthe only reason i kept my cool is the two ladies are elderly the vegetables they sell are not fresh almost everything looks pricy and old the only reason they survive is because they are the only indian grocery store in the area i wish we have more options like in edisonstore management please learn to treat your customers with respect i have seen your staff doing this to couple of my friends and their families separately as well as other customers you need us as much you you think we need you this is not the corner store in india you are in the us please act like it,negative
VjiPyjyk6_fr-HO85u174g,the food here is good not as good as tiffin but still better that some other popular indian places the naan in particular is great chicken was dry but the sauces masala and korma were good saag paneer was okhowever we will not be ordering here again we ordered at 645 dinner arrived at 920 we live 14 miles away and i called multiple times to be answered with 5 minutes and hung up on right we're pretty patient people but this was truly unacceptablethe food was good but certainly not worth the wait next time we're going back to tiffin,negative
zYyVEC0IF86xSHF3GFmvkg,this place is a joke 12 bucks for a cup of navrathna korma  which is supposed to have 9 different veggies instead had a sprinkling of beans and peas with lots of heavy cream yuck if they can't get this basic indian recipe right stay away i am indian and this is the worst indian restaurant i have eaten in,negative
ur84JezPd2IN5PN4J-fEVw,mannn i really wanted to have an awesome indian food truck near school  this place disappoints time and time again  the chicken tikka masala is just really bland and although it looks great it lacks all flavor  the food also takes a while so it won't be a quick grab and go esp if there are others waiting in line  this place is definitely not satisfying in any way so get new delhi or tandoor or even sitar delivered if you don't want to make the walk,negative
JZ3vxABa1FgATcgJl1PeNA,this place was a highly rated place on yelp so i decided to go there i'm from philly so the city here has some good indian buffets i'm not sure if i was early or something but i came at noon and the selection of curries was good but no appetizers no samosas or other small snacks the dessert was a weird tasting yellow pudding and jello no authentic or even regular indian desserts only good thing i liked was the fresh nan they served,negative
f82dhKNiUXsDVPMLqKYiIQ,having enjoyed lunches and dinners at sherepunjab i regret to write that our recent dinner was so disappointing when we arrived at the end of the day the outside lights were not lit and we wondered if the restaurant was indeed open we were promptly shown to a table we quickly observed that both the server and the person who brought water were untrained the server was surly the food was merely satisfactory the shrimp curry was awful the onion naan was tasty the mixed vegetarian appetizer was ok we paid our bill at the unlit kiosk i used my iphone's light to read the bill the person who accepted our credit card seemed clueless we might return for the selfserve luncheon buffet but not for dinner,negative
rB067lnTKVSiMU46z24BHg,seriously underwhelmed with this place came here for a work lunch and everyone seemed meh about their food as well cool atmosphere though i got the tabouleh topped with mahi mahi it came in a fried tortilla shell random and had zero flavor after generous applications of salt hot sauce and even salad dressing it was still lacking much taste fortunately the tortilla shell was good  of course it was it was fried  despite not really being a sensible accompaniment to the dish if i came back i would stick to the british fare the curries looked decent kind of my fault for expecting to get good tabouleh here,negative
NB5XTBuLVCn7c9Lu5SUqKg,disappointed with my experience here my waiter was amazing and funny the food was good however the sheer capacity in the middle of a pandemic right after the mayor put the new rules in affect to curb covid19 were not followed we saw parties of 8 and 10 there was no distance between seating and the hostess made a big fuss when we asked to be seated away from other people they had one side of the restaurant filled and the other side was empty very strange they did not enforce mask rules and let people walk around and come in without masks i can say with certainty i will not be coming back to this restaurant and would rather go to a restaurant who enforced safety measures my motherinlaw reported them to the health department which is how bad the measures were,negative
DucrEk1GbKkM18MlKVuSRw,attempted to patronize this location with my husband but they said that they no longer accepted the groupon nonexpired for this location when i asked why  the woman who worked there reported you can get a full refund from groupon so overall very disappointed that they did not honor the groupon that was recently purchased and poor customer service as they did not care to go into detail as to why the groupon voucher would not be acceptedwon't be back,negative
WaiWU5UbTsvfkYMHI5i5_A,customers aren't valued buffet is little expensive people are forced to finish food before closing times we will be informed the closing times i have experienced management picking up a dish filled with deserts also turning off the lights while people are still eating was insultingi'm sorry i won't enter that place again and i won't suggest any of my friends to try too,negative
iAE5tMDs1XSudlEzG-Z3aA,food is bland but fine if you like blandlast time we went maybe the only time the manager kept pushing the lunch buffet on us coming to our table and telling us about it and that we should come to it like 3 times made us not want to go,negative
yDO5dZR1FOgNsF7tZ4UFdQ,waiting time and the attitude in restaurent is very bad they did not even apologies for the wait time they made us to we waited roughly 40mins just for a single biriyani pickup however the taste be  i would not sugggest my friends there to try,negative

GABa_C0I4PTTa_-aLUo0aQ,very overpriced for what you are getting i was not impressed with the shrimp or the chicken they should offer a sampler meal to atleast get people to want to try new foods the inside decor is ok the service was nice but nothing was even closely impressive for me wanting to return,negative
BwUWmUFKCuJ-nN9vFwMt2Q,very very disappointing my boyfriend and i were really excited to try himalayannepalese food for the first time the experience was regrettable we looked on yelp to find dinner and found this restaurant with mixed reviews the negative reviews were unfortunately the ones we found to be the most accurate first the service was horrible normally poor service doesn't bother me if the food is good but this service was despicable and the food was not good so theres that the stuffed bread we ordered with the meal was uncooked literally dough with burn marks on the outside the waiter said yea they make them too thick when we told him he brought out another round of bread at the end of our meal this time with no filling and at full price even though we wanted it as an appetizer to go with our soup the soup was the best part small size but tasty the meal went downhill from there faster than the himalayan mountains themselves the yak was whatever not awful but certainly not worth the price the vegetarian momos were disgusting and desperately needed the dipping sauce for them to even be palatable also in the middle of our meal the bus boy came over and took away the flowers and table decorations like the restaurant was closing it was 9pm and they advertise closing at 10pm we got there at 845pm despite the place being nearly empty our waiter was barely seen when we got up to ask if we could please have some water the food was salty we found our waiter in the back eating his own dinner he did not get up and get us water he told us to ask someone else at the front  two people wearing jackets who we didn't even know worked there who i'm pretty sure must have been their delivery drivers it took forever to get our check as well this place must have changed ownerships avoid it,negative

y7pKM3eFDZ9eRchC6SNMsA,i found two hairs in one vegetable pakora and this was in my leftovers that means when we dined in we may have consumed more i feel sick writing this out our family was a fan of this place for years this is so devastating because they were already going down hill in our opinions with quality and cleanliness of the restaurant one of the older men will harass you and not leave the table while you try and eat i don't think we will ever be back unless they go under new management or shut down to seriously clean and reestablish cleaner habits like wearing proper hair nets and facial masks for bearded chefs so happy royal india opened,negative

Yz4BD3vf8-d14j2T2FgYxA,house of india is okay because of its location it caters to nonindians as the flavors are inconsistent with traditional indian flavors for the particular dishesthey typically use the base and curry meant for one dish for other dishes too rendering everything with virtually the same flavorthe buffet is messy and the naan taste cheaply made  like leftover biscuits they are super doughy and after a few minutes become hard and chewythe vegetarian selection for the buffet is standard stuff no one wants to eatthe desserts are also standard overly sweetened and taste like leftoverswhen ordering from the menu the dishes are bland and even when asking for spicy the dishes are lacking flavor  just overly spiced uponly go here if you can't go elsewhere,negative

NDzQFHW671hbB-aArOy12A,i really used to like this place have been visiting this since it was opened brought a lot of colleagues and friends here it used to a nice and cozy family restaurant with really good ethnic foodi have been observing this place is heading in the wrong direction for a while  quality and portion size going down while they are increasing the price consistently today's visit was the last straw that broke the camel's back i am never coming back few years back we used to order chicken combo with a price of 999 now it is 13  beef bihari used be 1099 now it is 15 the portion size is getting smaller as well the cost of the ingredients are not going up it seems the owner's greed is going up the quality of food leaves something to be desired if you know how the authentic food should tastenot recommended at all anymore,negative
DTv2J5HBWEdIm9NSwsiFbQ,i wanted to give a good dining experience for my wife on her birthday i took her to aman's and we ordered special nonveg platter chicken biryani butter naan and chicken shahi kormathe good good ambiance good service so so soft butter naan and very very tasty chicken shahi korma coming to the bad chicken biryani turned out to be a salty biryani chicken kabaab in the nv platter tasted bitter due to excessive asafoetida powder in it and no salt at all  i had lunch buffet many times here it is worth the money and would give a good rating for that,negative
t47GOxTM-RpfNs0IqHzJTg,ok please take this as truthwait to eat here when they have the rat problem under control  also guestionable food handling but very tasty,negative
ngvE1G9IckUO-ljZBFo23w,the food is inexpensive and the service is quick so i really appreciate that  though the convenience factor is here for sure for a quick meal or delivery i was not wowed with the food  the sag paneer was subpar at best and the chicken tikka was not very good,negative
zYyVEC0IF86xSHF3GFmvkg,have eaten their several times in the past with mediocre results but most recently during mardi gras my friends and i all got food poisoning and we all had different entrees probably had them sitting out ready to sling onto the tables possibly this is due to the heavy traffic during mardi gras but i will not be taking any more chances with them,negative
EzjysPg2-lVX1E0ibStUXw,the menu price is a suggestion and not accurate don't be surprised when you have to give up your first born for mediocre at best indian food,negative
xYfX43qH2bLNKpcqINdS_g,the only reason they get an extra star is because of the customer service the employees there are niceotherwise this place is probably the most mediocre and bland indian food i've ever had maybe its an off day but its we ordered on whats basically a friday we got the lamb korma gobi manchurian chicken 65 and some garlic naan gobi manchurian was straight up breading with a hint of sweet tomato the look of cauliflower and a wish there was more than an aftertaste of spice  chicken 65 is pretty much the same as the gobi manchurian but better only because it has spice and spiciness covers everything else  lamb korma has pretty decently cooked lamb it's soft and tender but that all the good i have for this dish korma is supposed to be creamy but instead it taste like straight oil it was akin to eating lamb with a spoonful oil no real spice or flavor at allprices are decent but i think that's all that's enticing about this place,negative
DucrEk1GbKkM18MlKVuSRw,i see all the good reviews so maybe they just can't handle delivery but if thats the case they need to remove themselves from grubhub etc this is my second time ordering the first time i ordered they messed up my order and gave me the wrong entree but the spinach naan was good so i decided to try them again this time when i opened up my spinach naan it had a red filling so clearly not spinach but there is a tomato naan on their menu so i figured fine as long as its good i'll accept it i take a bite and have an immediate allergic reaction and i can feel the crunch and know i've eaten nuts there is a naan on their menu that has raisins and cashews in it this is definitely the raisin naan but someone obviously put cashews in it i try calling the restaurant and am sent straight to voicemail so i start a chat with eat24com the representative tells me they've spoken with the restaurant and the restaurant says that they don't have a naan with cashews as if we can't read menu then they tell me they can bring the spinach naan but it will take 25 hours for redelivery 25 hours for some bread thats probably already premade and delivery to a house 5 minutes away that or a credit because they claim to have given me what i requested this was after i sent the eat24 customer support a picture of the clearly red naan so i said fine since they want to be smart claiming a 25hr redelivery time knowing that they close in 30 mins i want the redelivery and they can come pick up this naan they claim is spinach that changed their tune and i got a refund instead of an eat24 credit it was absolutely ridiculous all i had to go through for a 6 refund i spent over 25 with them each time i ordered why would i make up an allergic reaction for 6 customer service sucks and the food is meh,negative
ysbTBbwqtqoA-37H4CW18Q,0 stars for service as alwaysthis used to be my fav indian restaurant in town until recently today was a total disappointment on food too not sure if they changed the chef or started using different ingredients food lost its flavor,negative
q6661I3CGW0UB740E5Zjfw,my rule on indian restaurants is if they have a buffet that serves the traditional offerings then it's a recommendation unfortunately this place's lunch buffet fell short every place i know of has chicken marsala on their buffet line although i appreciate the spice variety that they offered i was hoping for a little bit more tradition and the tofu in the saag was dry very disappointedthe only reason they get 25 is because they let our dog onto their patio and gave us a container for water otherwise they would've only received a 1 star,negative
gehpdMAI1yDrtg4uTUba7A,the food was horrendous if could give the place zero stars i wouldmy food was cold so i needed to heat it up again while i was eating i saw something in it i flip it over and it turns out to be a cockroach yes a cockroach if you don't believe me look at the pictures below i thank the lord every night that i didn't eat it or know if i ate it it was the worst experience in my life i want to let everyone know that this place needs to be burned down because that is unacceptable someone needs to call the health department please warning do not go in for your own safety,negative
YsgNELwtqulRa3l3armcLA,having been introduced to indian food only within the past year or so i was excited to try a new spot when invited with a coworker  others spoke highly the reviews were generally good so after lunch i was disappointed to say the leasti've only ever gotten indian food a la carte for dinner so the lunch buffet was a new experience for me  i personally didn't think the selection was great but there was plenty to try and the staples were there  i loaded up my plate with nan tandoori chicken chicken tikka chicken curry and chicken kofta covered with a generous scoop of raita  let me say that i am a total spice weenie so when i eat indian i load up on the raita  the food at india palace didn't even need it  if you're looking for heat add some of the sauces at the end of the buffet  if you're looking for the most mild indian food experience you've ever had come to india palace  mild doesn't even begin  the food besides lack of heat was generally good though nothing to write home about  i've had better in even my limited experiencei'd say the scariest part of my experience was the location  outdated and it screamed grimy  i was afraid to touch much  it's in serious need of a facelift and they can start in the elevator  frightening  i didn't even bother peeking in at the bathroom  i held it until i got back to work,negative
JEpsrFGIH4ixJJ4q2yUb_A,godavari claims to be the best south indian restaurant in delaware on their  website however good their food might have been no restaurant can claim to be the best if they dont have any customer service we were driving from dc to nj and godavari was on the way the website said it closed at 10pm so we called ahead at 9pm just to ensure that their kitchen is open the person who answered was rude and outright refused to seat us since we were arriving 25 mins before closing time our eta to reach there was 935pm he said that the kitchen closes at 930pm we cannot eat there but if we want we can place an order and pickupwe consulted the menu online and called back to place an order for pickup at 920pm the same person answered the phone and said that the kitchen has already closed we reminded him that he had said it closes at 930pm earlier but he wasn't one to listen never have i seen a restaurant that relies on customers for their business turn down people so rudely without even a sorry for the inconvenience if they wanted to close early they should update their business hours on the website or at least they could have said so when we called  that way we could've found other places to eat in the meanwhile0 stars if it was possible  since we did not even get to eat the food,negative
h0tUOsL3sRYVqSQlxWjW5g,this was our third time eating here and it was delicious but i was very disappointed in the price  i didn't see a price posted anywhere for the buffet and assumed it was still 995 on weekdays as it was before but it was 1295 even for my 10 year old daughter who had one plate  when i asked the owner informed me it hasn't been that price for years which is interesting since my first visit was less than a year ago  perhaps if they didn't bring you three items that you didn't request naan bread some kind of crepes and a mango drink they could keep it more affordable   42 for lunch for 2 adults and a kid is a lot for us  shame on me for not clarifying the price  we will definitely not go back,negative
gc78zTDUGGJ3743UR5aBew,lunch buffet is extremely limited in options for vegetarians the only options they had was dal makhni and sag paneer for meat eaters there were three different kinds of chicken  doesn't worth to spend 13 on a lunch with very little options at least for vegetarian specially when there are other options available on the same street they need to add more options,negative
6rYratsrQNh6_cPWjlMopw,typing as i eat  the food served during lunch was not at all fresh it was a hot sunny day in wynnwood and we ordered jal jira that more like mildly salted water nothing else the rice served was clearly not fresh dry and hard waiter and cook did nothing when brought to their notice service was pretty bad disappointed ,negative
t81dbgfs0gNVflIRRP1XRA,the service was excellent very friendly but the food was bland they did bring the heat but the veg biyrani lacked the traditional and lovely complexity of spices the veggies consisted of only peas and carrots seemingly from a freezer the yogurt saucy stuff was strangely watery and without taste  the goat biryani had barely more flavor but the meat was dry and chewy please we need a good biryani place up the quality and spices,negative
-I7M6l0h46VdiN09Y1NUZw,i do acknowledge that there is a wait time of 30min that was initially conveyed but the fact that we were sitting outside in 54f for 45 minutes without an update from the host is the reason for this rating do remember that we would have paid not only for the food but also the service too bad wanted to give these guys a try,negative
KbhKbjG7fVM2vTtO3qbe0w,first let's start with the positives decor ambience and veggie plates were all good or solid the pani puri dish as well as the samosa dish were tasty albeit pricy 6 for 4 pani puri and 9 for 2 samosas they were good certainly not the best i've ever had but still goodnow onto the negatives to start i was given a dirty glass with lipstick on it however i was not wearing lipstick gross this was swapped after 15 minutes and i had to share a glass of water with my boyfriend now as for the rest of the food the shrimp and grilled chicken small plates were very bland and in fact served at room temp so much for labeling these dishes under hot apps and firecrackers the shrimp was essentially a shrimp with tomato sauce nothing special or remarkable at all the grilled chicken had no grill marks the chicken itself was as bland as boiled chicken and they attempted to mask the blandness with a mediocre cream and spice sauce extremely disappointed with our experience after hearing positive reviews we had planned on ordering more food but were so disappointed by the dirty glass and food that we left and ate elsewhere in summary if you eat here stick to the vegetarian dishes expect to spend more than you should make sure your glass and silverware is clean before you use it honestly i think indian street food is a bit overly priced here at chaatable if you're looking for authenticity this may not be your go to place they have dishes such as sliders brussels sprouts and lambchicken dishes that are infused with indian flavors in nashville but aren't your traditional goto dishes,negative
TAtDOJ3J4Oto83W_TI2edg,one of the worst experience ordering online butter naan they sent some old burnt roti chicken tikka butter masala  found curry leaves in the curryit was so pathetic that would recommend all never to order from this place,negative
6fYIlInL937IBuHmocfiBA,slow but apologetic service weak cocktails do not go here if you want indian food it's literally just another cajuncreole restaurant and the food is exceedingly mediocre at best,negative
zIDuAuwyaLmNwv4k18mbwA,i lived on the west side for 15 years and thru these years it never fails the menwaiters at this place would start to ask me where are you from do you have punjabi friends it's uncalled for and unprofessional and there was new people in there working constantly at least the often times i've been there i could never enjoy my lunch without getting hit on or talked to and they will stand there at my table expecting to hold a conversation i don't appreciate that at all and i was usually with my mom and sometimes now that i have a daughter the reason why we came here is because of the convenient location we were usually there for the lunch buffet the food was good now that i've moved closer to avon recently i rather go to the delhi place or haveli the food is just as good if not then better the indian palace needs to hire men that are more professional and not woman hungry and for that reason i probably won't return for a sit down dine in at this locationedit so we came to dine there sometime near fall of new decors updated the place very nice this time i actually enjoyed my meal without any disturbances,negative
fn8vsDc7vjPKYiwGe1XaYg,any one that eats here and thinks it's great has no idea what indian food is suppose to be  it really leaves me wondering who's in the kitchen and what of nationality the food has a tremendous amount of oil and not well spiced this is as americanized as it gets but not in a good way i was really hoping this place would be better after its reopening as driving to north tampausf is a pain in order to get decent indian food but this is overall a disappointment there is no competition for indian food in st pete so hopefully someone will keep trying and finally get it right,negative
nO-rCnSpUSlve4w9iJ64gA,i'm new to this towni got chicken biriyani from this locationnever tasted this kind of biriyani in my life the only thing i don't like is they are advertising as their biriyani is best in town i don't think it is a best biriyani in town i say worst biriyani in the town better avoid it,negative
TYCBZT8UuovCUgFob15xoA,i wish i could give zero starsi came here because i thought it was flavours of india and i didn't knew it was overtaken by mirchithe green chutney they served with appetiser was stale and the curd was stinkingthere was lot of artificial food colour in butter paneernan was cold and biryani was extremely spicyand on top of all it was overpricedutter disappointment,negative
9-tZDrMjJYBbpCJoU3WXAQ,one of us got actual food poisoning cramps sweats the whole nine yards the other just felt woozy the next day the men on the phone were very rude and dismissive and they replaced one of our dishes with another they were out of what we wanted without calling to ask about it on top of all that the food was gross i tried dousing it with chili powder and then just threw most of it out nothing redeeming here,negative
2iQucreJtTqbEsLczhsgrA,i walked in based on the other reviews  place was dead quiet noone there   the carpet was very dirty  i figured if the carpet looks like this and there is noone even there how does the kitchen look  so i left  maybe it is a good restaurant but they certainly should clean especially when they have nothing else to do then went directly across the street  that place was busy   wonder why,negative
qXZmhZtCpTH6wlnUT75zmw,do not try haleem here worst ever it's lentils and some combination of mutton pieces they call it as haleem been craving waste of money worth 16u feel you had  lentils soup donotever,negative
TVX2a4bVuCE2VUIkiLdZrQ,had a horrible experience while lunch we ordered two curries one veg and non veg and garlic nan both the curries were literally thin and taste less there were no vegetables added except only paneer when we complained chef was like you must have eat all vegetables and now complaining it was curry with salt and red pepper that's all and when we just complained chef was like you guys are lying and was acting very rude,negative
FIDLmYEuCtSj_rc8lqaKFw,wish i could review this based on the food but i can't i can only review this based on the fact that we placed on order on here through uber eats it was confirmed by the restaurant then an hour and a half later the uber driver called to say the place was closedwe ordered during their operating hours and it was confirmed bad business practice,negative
6_LnAQQ0-mml8YgpfRjGuA,i travelled 2 hours for their sandwiches which were basically a vomit of various sauces on a soggy bun i'm not zabihaonly and maybe this crap food is considered awesome by the zabiha crowd but there is much better  quality food out there shame on saad's for pushing poorly prepared food on a zabiha crowd that simply doesn't know better,negative
WIYMl1aBJpCS1ed1e53GGw,went here today expecting to buy myself lunch from spice end but to my surprise found masala kitchen in place of spice end limited menu no vada pav etc that spice end offered of kathi rolls and biryanis i got the paneer masala and lamb kebab i found both pretty dry and not thaaaat tasty super bummed that spice end closed down,negative
y9nVAyd9u-ofORtRZ1-ePQ,super disappointed with the lunch buffet i don't venture out much with an infant and if i do it's usually within a 15 min drive home i really wanted to take my dad who is a vegetarian to try this buffet out it was such a waste of a trip the south indian food was sub par  sambar idly dosa was ok and rasam was decent the samosa chat was good ragda patties was average and all the vegetable dishes were ok they had a weird combo of vegetables kidney beans with okra and green peppers umm ok not a dish to be made in any indian kitchen at home i'm all for experimenting but this combo is a failthe dessert was decent  good gulab jamun gajar halwa was ok my dad enquired if the chai has sugar in it after one sip he said  no sugar and no tea leaves either it was like hot flavored brown color milk probably not going to come back anytime soon,negative
sZqNECDqldtUk-SDjLg9rw,this is terrible in all the times i have had indian food it has never been this watery i didn't order soup i ordered chicken curry and dahl mahkani  it really upsets me because i traveled across town for this to give it a shot just to be hugely disappointed  if you are looking for good indian food where they actually care about the quality go to taste of india or bawarchi,negative
Yz4BD3vf8-d14j2T2FgYxA,i remember going here as a child after church with various indian families and enjoying the food i had recently introduced my boyfriend to indian food and brought him heremy chicken tikki marsala was bland not terrible but nothing special   my boyfriend ordered tandoori chicken  his pieces of chicken were charred and had a bittersour taste  none of the flavors i associate with tandoori chickenfor an indian buffet taj palace in chesterfield is amazing  and just a normal sit down dinner himalayan yeti  both have amazing indian food,negative
2f6NaQVGTM59OGvsdT9pxg,dear sir     i am just now seeing your response to my review shamefully almost two years later i was thinking of visiting your great city soon and came across your reply  since quite some time has past this may no longer be the case  however your complete dismissal and denial of my experience from there warrants a response  no matter how much time has passed i beseech you to check out your late night delivery orders before you flag legitimate reviews i found your restaurant from yelp there wasn't  any mistaking it for some other your excellent reviews are the reason i chose mood indian every establishment  can have a bad dayevening  for you to say you didn't see any record of my transaction is absurd i'm sure you will continue your 4 star reviews if you continue to flag the ones you don't agree with  if you truly care about the service of your  patrons locals as well as the one just passing through your city i would implore you to spot check your sunday late night deliveries to see what they send out as a suggestion just order something and have it sent to any nearby hotel have it delivered to the front lobby and meet them i was staying at the wyndham  400 arch street if that is not in your delivery area please reply back and i will retract my review and give my most sincere and humble apology i wrote this review due to an epic fail of my experience  far from excellence like i had read from other yelpers i thought you should know in order to preserve your 4star rating no matter what hour your patrons order,negative
imrScxmgoU_5ftSoE9Bx-w,few months ago they have a lot of varieties  today they only have a few tray of foods  basically beef chicken or veggies  799 pick two choices with rice and two small piece of nan  not much of choices  how can they compete with a panda express right next door and offer more choices  this time the nan was cold and soggy  i was about to complain but seeing that their business is so slow and about to fold up i ate it anyway  actuallytheir foods is pretty good  but with no business which the freshness of the foods will be a serious factor  if they don't come up with a quick strategy this business will be in serious trouble  i'd hate to see them go out of business,negative
rGkaQhhBMgb6UWBa8-XDug,one and a half stars  wanting indian food to go i called this place because their rating on yelp was so high  i asked for baignan bharta no eggplant on the menu the veg biryani i got tasted like stovetop stuffing  bland with small bits of vegetables and shortgrained rice i later realized that i have eaten the buffet at their other location in center city  it was ok but still bland with uninteresting selections i get it that this place is all about value not fine dining but mumbai bistro is a highly americanized version of indian food  a halfway decent meal for people who don't know indian food,negative
y7pKM3eFDZ9eRchC6SNMsA,i am writing this review as i am eating food at this awful place and this is not first time here i have been here 6 times the staff are rude and the lady owner is just rude i am from chicago and an india and i know exactly how indian food tastes in in us i ordered biryani and it's worst biryani ever pls don't waste money here eat som where else,negative
BfsWnuF3fm4g1fM9NdVi0w,dinner  we loved this place the first two times we went there it seemed classy n food was amazing but the experience about couple of weeks back was not that good there was only one waiter serving the entire restaurant  it took almost an hour for us to get our order further the quality seemed to be degraded a lot hope they come back to original standard soon,negative
fOTDwlJdgwuGTbYrjt_88Q,i really wanted to like nala see my reviews of a few other local indian places but the food here just isn't up to the standards we had the weekend buffet so maybe the regular a la carte menu is better i can't confirm and won't return to find outthe restaurant itself is nice actually one of the better places spacious and well decorated the staff is very pleasant and attentive they brought a special omelet for our son which would have been very appreciated except it was spicy and so went uneateneven with 10 dishes i didn't find anything i would review positively ok the rice and desserts were fine as another reviewer pointed out everything was very spicy which is neither good nor bad in and of itself i know there are regional variations to indian food but these were not typical norther or southern dishes maybe it's like home style food if so please don't invite me to dinner,negative
VpJzlz3bKOJtiI1rb9kTpw,the vegetarian dishes were very good  i am not a vegetarian mushroom palak was exceptional  dal soup tasted delicious but was cooked to the point of no texture  the zucchini dish was very goodthere was no chicken biryani the entire time i was there  the chicken curry was bland  the red chicken not tikka masala was ok but i took the last and it was not replenishedpeople were pleasant nice interior cleaner than a lot of indian restaurantsi am frankly surprised it enjoys such a good reputation  there are many great indian restaurants around the city,negative
Vi-fP-83MHFztVbM0emKSg,service really is horrible and very impolite staff  they act as if they are doing you a favor by filling in the items for buffet  when atleast 15 people are waiting to get their plates filled and all they bring is a small bowl to refill  food is okay  but i would not go back just because of the staff ,negative
ycm91tre_R4pRoV0STawSQ,okay i have a number of complaintsthere's no ambiance the wall decorations are sparse and uncoordinated we were one of the only people in here eating there was no music so it was really uncomfortable we felt like we couldn't even talk without being listened toalso it was hot we were both sweating throughout dinner the rice was undercooked and the naan was over cooked the waiter never refilled our water he also paid zero attention to us throughout the dinner despite being the only people in the restaurant it took 30 minutes to get our food the naan came out with out main food which is fine but annoying considering we were hungry and specified that we wanted it as a starter when we were done eating our waiter took 20 minutes to bring us the check because he was on his phone,negative
zIDuAuwyaLmNwv4k18mbwA,wish there is a zero rating option  worst place to eat  i hate to relive the experience but want to be of help to anyone who even think of eating here  mango lassi was the worst  well the personnel working there are even bad  food was crappy when we informed our waitress that food was bad  she just laughed and asked if we want dessert  we were a party of 7 and none liked the food  wish they close the place just out of respect to food,negative
AXoq_ze4DyyPDjJk-Ba9Pw,this place doesn't even deserve 1 star it deserves zeroi know authentic indian food i have indian friends i know how to cook basic food like rice eggs etc and i have plenty of experience w restaurantsunfortunately this place is a ripoff i only went in w my partner because i wasn't the one paying driving we were hungry and we wanted to try this place that looked newit's a ripoff because 70 of the food is rice and the rest isn't that good either for the amount they chargei can make what they make with no problem just make rice and then combine the rice with thingsother nono's arethe naan was a little mushy when it should be warm  crispy w garlic on itthe included desert was even more silly and not good and since when does desert come includedthe food was hot even though i ordered mild which is supposed to be the least spicy of their threethe mango juice was little for the pricethe vegetables were a little too hard which most likely means they didn't cook it enoughas far as experience they play weird old nondance indian music that even indians don't listen to the bathroom and bathroom door needs improvement the door of the bathroom requires manhandle force to open you need a microscope to be able to read the menu they use fluorescent bulbs which further shows that they're trying to be cheap fluorescent bulbs make you feel tired because they emit harmful negative radiation led's is what you use if you wanna save enough saidso unless you have money to blowoff don't believe me andor wanna see for yourself i wouldn't gobtw most of the indian restaurants in the city of tucson were just like this but not as bad as this unless you're in a highend area like phoenix especially scottsdale i wouldn't go,negative
h0tUOsL3sRYVqSQlxWjW5g,the restaurant website allowed me to place an online order and select the time of pick up to be 455 i showed up to a closed restaurant saying it opens at 5 i went in at 5 to pick up my order and they said they had just started working on it an hour later the order was ready several other disgruntled guests showed up to pick up there orders as well and had the same issues  they did nothing to compensate for the inconvenience and the continuous promises that the order would be ready in 5 minutes instead of telling the truth if i could give them a negative rating i would i will not be returning to this restaurant ever again and would be surprised if they stay in business given the lack of customer service,negative

oinV9xrSkR3b_T8sK1nsqg,i was excited about visiting after reading all the hype i liked the ambiance but was uncomfortable with the seating the lack of indian people should've been a tipoff to me great flavors but old food imo waiter said spice levels could not be altered  code for this food may or may not have been made a week ago i would give this place a hard pass,negative
Zz4pFK6G5K0nyYYCj89YPQ,our second visit the first was so great we had to  come back the first time we didn't realize it was 15 minutes before closing they treated us like royalty without any rush the grecia pasta and pasta athena were both outstanding they use all fresh homemade ingredients service was superb we had baklava for dessert it was amazing don't miss this great dinner spot,positive

U4DpkzcADkXFZzYaX9smjQ,we have quite a few mediterranean restaurants in peoria but none measure up to this place my wife and i have eaten here several times over several trips and we've never had a bad meal the dolma entree is huge with 15 items not just grape leaves on the plate my wife loves it and it's a great value compared to what we're used to in peoria we also tried the saffron chicken not quite as amazing as many reviews made it out to be but solid sultan pilau delicious and mixed grill all meats were good  even the ground beef usually not my favorite kabob item was seasoned beautifully even the rice that came as a side was great i don't usually compliment rice or even pay attention to it but it was very moist and remained so when i heated up leftovers the next day the pickled vegetable salad sides were good too and the saffron cake is amazing if they have it for dessert the lentil soup is great as well a little spicy but tolerable though i don't think they offer it as a free appetizer anymore the only thing i didn't care for was the rice pudding since i'm not a fan of roseflavored food but my wife loved itoverall this is now a staple of our st louis visits if we're in that area of the city,positive
6ajnOk0GcY9xbb5Ocaw8Gw,this restaurant is amazing for a cozy intimate date it's very dark inside and most of the lighting is coming from the numerous candles in the small space i loved the ambiance the food as well was filling i recommend getting a pizza and the gnocchi those two can fill up a couple but if you're really hungry i recommend getting one of their many delicious dishes i tried the meatballs and they were very flavorful the pricing was also decent and the ambiance felt fancy and nice highly recommend for a date spot,positive

2DTkzhmMpv5fIPKheePClA,i did go to this place with high expectations and it delivered  last time when i was in nola i missed out on this restaurant so this visit i made a reservation for the day i landed back here i am big on taking food pictures unfortunately the lighting in this location is not that great to do justice to the food we ate  the ambiance is however gorgeous it looks so simple from outside yet your taste buds and you are transported to another destination  the price is very reasonable when it comes to for the table getting to try 5 from the list for just 23 dollars is amazing  the portion size is not that big but the ingredients used are so fresh  i never thought i would enjoy peas so much as i did from their menu  the pita here are delicious i am not even sure how someone can make pita so good  they are soft fluffy steamy and the right amount of salt in them  even though it is painful to suggest but try not to fill yourself up with the pita  the food even though small in portion the quality makes you full and the large plates are substantial in size   when the lamb kebabs were being walked to the table you could smell the cumin chilies garlic and cinnamon  so the service here is slow but that is i believe intentionally  they want you to sit and enjoy it leisurely to get the right experience  talk eat drink and repeat if they had a cot somewhere i would add nap to the list too  we ordered shakshuka for the large plate and the green chili paste on the top of each poached egg was like emeralds on top  this shakshuka was unlike any i have had in the past a lot of vegetables in this one and the sweet salty and tangy flavors going on there  you know it is good when folks at your table are stuffed but must keep going for one more bite  overall a very satisfying meal and lives up to its name of worthy offering,positive

2DTkzhmMpv5fIPKheePClA,since dining at shaya each mention of it to friends has elicited an audible gasp widening of the eyes and a hushed simple question steeped in anticipation how was itit was incredible this particular experience was on a whim and very last minute we were being treated as true guests at my best girls birthday as money has been tight and dining on my own dime at this james beard nominated restaurant was not within our wallets' scopeamong the five of us we tried thirteen dishes and each one was a miniature concerto which developed the experience as a whole meala symphonywe ate goat cheese stuffed peppers baba ganoush carrots okra hummus with white corn and chilled tomato salad our server was instructed to take our order as a whole and course out according to what the chef deemed appropriate to pair and in an order that would progress as it was intended now that's fancyso naturally the second course featured the fried halumi and roasted cabbage with tahini third course was chickencous cous and roast lamb with whipped feta whipped feta y'all i said it that night and several times sinceif i was on death row and i was requesting my last meal it would be that lamb it was worthy of being the last thing i ever taste geeze louisewe ordered desserts like fools since we were already fat and full but it's a birthday dinner and you have to end on a sweet note we tried the milk and honey cheesecake watermelon sorbet and the chocolate cake which wasn't a cake lacking the official term for the dessert but it was so goodwhat stands out most for me about this food was the time and preparation that went into each dish although the tapas were simple and straightforward there were components that made you think of the prep it took to make it appear so effortless that's an art form in addition my boyfriend is a very picky eater i deliberately chose not to tell him too much about where we were eating because he would have looked at the menu and said let's go somewhere else but he was delighted he tried everything and surprised himself with the fact that he liked it a lot if i can replicate that okra he'll never leave me lolsbottom line save your money go order things you can't pronounce this an experience you must have,positive
1klQuTKmJr-eMQPuFaQ5fg,i can't believe i hadn't eaten here before tonight everything on the menu is amazing my least favorite was the doner shwarma it's like thinly sliced steak but i still liked it i'm glad they were out of baklava so we got the other 2 desserts they were so good especially the cheesy one,positive

HEf0QXnhxrcIWxRfAbQ2iA,another lunch visit to saba and another outstanding meal saba is so inviting to hang at atmosphere and service are great along with amazing food the humus with charro poblano is awesome along with the eggplant and tasty hot pita bread i tried their roasted octopus this time and wow it was full of flavor and so tasty this place has it all great food with amazing cocktails and wonderful service enjoy,positive
2DTkzhmMpv5fIPKheePClA,the pita bread alone is a worth a visit here fresh and hot right out of the oven some pita bread can be dry but this is like a crescent roll but 100 times better they also have assortment of hummus we ordered the cauliflower onion and the sweetness of the onions complimented the hummus perfectly mujadara was ok  could've been more flavorful shakshuka was enjoyed and tomato sauce went nicely with the pita too staff was efficient friendly and accommodating as we had two kids with us they also have parking next to the restaurant,positive
Qkg16mN-8QR66gjzg6gMyw,once again convivo did not disappoint the food and service are consistently excellentmy mother likes to come up from los angeles for their ribsthe salad nicoise was amazing everything fresh and high quality except my photoi'm usually a dressing on the side person but didn't do that here it was perfectly dressed complimented and blended all the flavors without overpowering anything we had a nice table on the patio tables were well spacedthe only drawback everyone else's plates were cleared while i was still eating it made me feel a bit rushed i appreciate eager attention to detail though so left all 5 stars i will continue to recommend convivo to anyone who asks local and visitors alike,positive

C5ZOzlslhMxRJDjBDV3KoQ,i love this place  ordered my usual hot and crunchy tuna bowl and it was made perfectly as usual the tuna is fresh and the crunchy onions add a nice taste to the mix i always order the sticky white rice with this bowl the service is excellent and the staff is very friendly go check it out,positive
XIKYdKWq72zUYsq8NBxcCQ,this was my first time going there today the food was really really good the server was just so sweet and professional and the owner came out to speak with us and he was also very sweet we couldn't decide what we wanted because everything just sounds so good so i definitely will be back to try more dishes the curry tofu was really good it could've been a lot more spicy but i don't think it was meant to be a spicy dish so i'm not complaining  just my intake,positive
2DTkzhmMpv5fIPKheePClA,i was just there for my birthday and i loved absolutely everything i had my boyfriend would say the same i am a vegetarian and loved my options  the curried cauliflower hummus and the persian rice were total hits i also loved the shakshuka  a must for vegetarians a special shout out to the servers becky and kenzie for their incredible service as well i left so full and happy  had to finish every bite down to the chocolate halva cake at the end of our meal thanks again shaya i'll bee back soon,positive

xVZh156d7aBvdSCeWaoPQg,love the lobster risotto the wine selection is not as extensive as i'd hoped but they have a little bit of everything the service is soso they're not rude but not completely friendly either i don't like the ipad menu thing they give you to order from it's not user friendly and takes up room on the table this is a great girls night or intimate date night spot,positive
-W0tnXYJ4WuxLjzmbwlVAQ,my husband and i tried tavolo v for the first time and we were beyond impressed with everything it has officially become my new favorite restaurant our waiter toby was fantastic the food came out extremely quick and everything was unbelievably delicious it was so refreshing to go to a restaurant with so many vegetarian options listed we had three different appetizers cheese ravioli brussel sprouts and baby artichokes and each one was amazing my husband is a vegetarian and craves for fried chicken and the artichokes were a spot on replacement the coating tastes just like the best fried chicken coating you've ever had we also took in a few of their signature cocktails and each one was better than the next  beware they are strong overall i couldn't have asked for a better experience from the food and drink service décor and even the music selection it was tops across the board,positive
6ajnOk0GcY9xbb5Ocaw8Gw,food was delicious  menu has a variety of small and medium plate options which are ideal for sharing  the ricotta bruschetta was delicious as was the fig and arugula pizza i liked the octopus salad but it didn't do it for my husband it was a bit noisy for a tuesday evening but i still liked the vibe and enjoyed the food so i would definitely go back,positive
2c7P0KF6WcozKg7WFk2YyQ,wow amazing no second doubts for ones who know the taste of momos in india and are dying to get that taste best part it's right in front of amc castleton,positive

mlrzM-jUkKot28XJhScuuA,this place is a great healthy choice for a decent amount of money check out their shakes i was very surprised i enjoyed it very much worth taking a stop by,positive
rt4mUIWH9SOR4NrPkivslQ,i come here whenever i need a good falafel sandwich or a dozen stuffed grape leaves  but really everything is good  i especially like the vegetarian sampler  the food is fantastic wellprepared and very fresh  it's a very successful place and i'm happy to see they will soon be expanding to a regular restaurant with tables and a woodburning oven to make their own pita  this is a great addition to the neighborhood because it brings greater diversity to our food choices here in florida,positive
0InojtGES0EuD3hfXGoeow,we went to the recently moved alma restaurant on mad beach  were very pleased i ordered a burger  it was cooked perfectly  delicious they have a great wine selection too service was very prompt  friendly we will be back again for sure  had an overall great experience,positive
GuzbBFraIq-fbkjfvaTRvg,probably one of the best vegan restaurants i've ever been to excellent food in a fabulous presentation outstanding service great locale prices are just right don't live in santa barbara but when i visit again i'd come back here,positive
uZYBF0YTU_iKq4_L_PDtMQ,the food was amazing i got really full and well nourished arianna my server was fairly attentive i think my comment first walking in made her uncomfortable its normal for a guy to make mistakes around pretty girls lol,positive
UaVFOX65gnMMRwgNL5KQiA,having spent many years in turkey it is good to find a place that matches the quality of the food i so enjoyed over there this one of only a handful of restaurant i tell people about my wife and i both love the food and very friendly staff i agree with amaliya l the baklava is great and is hand made and always fresh wish we have time to eat there every day,positive
hFbDsESgeSV-lN18i7BQFQ,we came starving here after our sunday morning workouts the place is small but they have additional seating upstairs it's chipotle style restaurant serving mediterranean food so you choose the food base protein  toppings and sauce the prices are very reasonable like 79 and apps around 4we ordered chicken shawarma on saj and on pita bread and shared grape leaves app food was being prepared right in front of you saj bread was unique and never tasted anything like it very tasty overall food taste was above average and portions were good grape leaves app was a lil more oily than usual you get 6 pieces for 4 what i didn't like was that they charge 2 for water not cooloverall i recommend this place if you are around spring garden area fair warning street parking can be a challenge,positive
fDkOfC0t9coGC34o8Nnjow,pros  the prix fixe menu 4 course is arranged such that with any course combination your overall dining experience will be a balanced one the flavor and texture combinations ranged from pretty good to orgasmic nothing less food presentation is good  wine nerd's delight  the service here is pleasant and highly efficient  they make you feel as if they're almost never there but they almost always are filling waters clearing empties bringing clean and courseappropriate flatware between courses cons  it was so damn hot in there  i'm not talking 7374  i'm talking 7778  to make matters worse the air in there is completely still and thick  it killed my appetite appetite you know that prerequisatory condition for enjoying food seating many of the tables were so close together that we didn't feel like our conversation could be private if we wanted it to be elaia's dim restaurantwide incandescent lighting sets a romanticish hue  which is an odd choice because not much else about this place is conducive to an intimate date tables close together remember not to mention the incandescent lighting does little to accentuate the colorful food  go if  you and a friend want to nerdout about food and wine also probably good for girls night for the classy 3040 crowd,positive
r8k5KtXqb9yxlMGE0BF6jA,so so so good the service here was great and the food was so damn good one of our favorites now only downside is byob ,positive
fKAxmycMFwO9qWVUAOQzOw,update 71419 they now have a separate vegan menu with increased gluten free options we got the jalapeño cheese bread gluten free and vegan and they are offering daiya cheesecake as a dessert so excited to see these options still my favorite pizza place in louisianahands down best gluten free pizza i've ever had and they have vegan cheese so so so good this will be a regular stop for me when in nola,positive
QV7QOLww8ym3E2zBgdE2Ow,delicious nice decor clean and the food was fresh and tasty we got a jerusalem pita sandwich and a chicken shawarma salad great service too,positive
GuzbBFraIq-fbkjfvaTRvg,although i am not a vegetarian or vegan i can confidently say mesa verde has some incredible food mesa verde is a great place for a casual date or catching up with friends i have enjoyed every appetizer and entree there the only criticism i have is that the drink menu is a bit limited overall if you're looking for a healthy restaurant with good service and a pleasant environment i highly recommended trying out mesa verde,positive
56R9jd6PBz9jEg_WDyP7Sw,this café is the gem of the riverwalk in tampa it rests on a patio of the tampa museum of art my friends and i arrived at the café around 300pm after a class we had taken at the museum we were greeted by a wonderful server named richard he made us feel like company instead of customers it was late in the afternoon and we chose the tarragon salad  this wasan excellent choice that everyone enjoyed the weather was quite warm but so was the service that was bestowed upon us due to the service the food and the personal touchesgiven to us through a wonderful culinary team richardtonyand edward i highly recommend this cafefor a very special afternoon at the museum or on the riverwalkb,positive
TzkVUJab9Sh0CqDk2sCF-w,there was a cockroach that almost crawled into my aunts hair i finally killed it and showed them on the napkin they were super rude and didn't apologize,negative
8C-G2bwZJLyThpUL5hzg9w,worst restaurant ever ever the staff were disgusting and not even respectful they were about to ask us to leave even when we try to speak with manager about our bad experience he said this is america if you like it or not  i'm not sure what he meant,negative
wa_bwyY57etHjtJ2Fw0E3g,if you want a hamburger or steak this isn't your jointso going to pita jungle was not my choice but my soon to be inlaw's choice  the patio is great to sit outside when it gets cooler out it's laid back atmosphere is very much vegan tree hugger  i guess if you like veggies and healthy stuff this is your place to go personally me i'm a meat and potato type of gal who isn't your typical i'll order a salad and water the prices are very reasonable and from what others ordered it appeared the deep friend cauliflower was amazing,negative
PweEiIooF2RSX2TLndn0dA,not an extensive menu  i ordered the lentil soup which was decent  my spouse ordered the grape leaves which resembled and tasted like canned grape leaves  the salad lacked that olive oillemon juice profile,negative
Qkg16mN-8QR66gjzg6gMyw,we went for cocktails and dinner on wednesday night  when we were finished with our cocktails and appetizers we ordered dinner at 700  we ordered two more appetizers two salads and two pasta dishes  we were served the salads and appetizers immediately  and then we waited and waited for our main course   we never saw our server after he served our salads even though we asked the busboy 3 times to have our server come over  when we still hadn't been served at 810 and our server had never been back to inquire if we wanted anything more to drink or let us know the status of our dinner we decided to leave and go to a local restaurant that we knew would enjoy dinner  it's ridiculous to have to wait 1 hr for a main course  and be completely ignored that entire time,negative
Hs5p15j2XBXoaPYFcKg32g,i'm the pizza snub but my whole family did not care  for the pizza we ordered two pizza's with one with 12 extra cheese well we could not discern where the extra cheese was it all seemed the same the pizza dough  crust tasted like cardboard the sauce was bland although the cheese seemed fresh overall bad pizza the kicker of the night was the odd behavior of the staff apparently my wife went to use the bathroom while waiting for our pizzas for takeout and on the way to the bathroom a staff member chased her down to see if she was a customer on the way out another staff member wanted to confirm her name to prove she was associated with out takeout order so overall the pizza was not so good and the restaurant staff was pretty rude i agree with a previous review there's plenty of places with great views that does not replace bad food and rude service,negative
dvTQNq-EGH1Omt318rlt1g,this place is not good i had the chicken shawarma sandwich which was flavorless and small it also didn't have any sides included so i left hungry food is overpriced for what you get and does not seem authentically mediterranean at all my wife ordered the chicken kufta and it was incredibly dry she asked for taziki to make it more palatable and was told it was an additional cost i would steer clear you will most likely regret your decision to eat here especially if you know what real mediterranean food tastes like,negative
KHkOgc6G_K7jUiEUv9bB6A,i was so excited to try the food and i was so disappointed the rice was greasy and the dolmas were dry i also asked to substitute a side dish so i could try the hummus but when i opened it at home i still got the veggie stew which was fine i wish i could give more stars but my expectations were high after reading the reviews,negative
WksAo-C-Wl4RRz4sgQjZLw,this naf naf just doesn't have the quality of the restaurant on market street in philadelphia they use way too much salt in preparation i eat at the one on market street about once a week and the one in marlton seems to over salt everything they should be the same in food preparation but they are not i hope it improves because i am a big fan of the franchise,negative
T3tiN6g7G2XUoDjRv3d8Cw,ambiance was interesting  school room chic  but wow the food was so disappointing  nice service   absurd wait outside in the cold to get staff tolet us in  door to go   it was easier to visit the white house with covid security measures but that's not really a bad thing   food really really not good at all  like any of it  tried the simple insalata so much lemon it was barely edible   fish app was over cooked and over salted broccoli rabe was ok   three pasta were all very average to not good   2 desserts were blah   we kept waiting for something to shine brightly after all the great reviews   nada  fell flat   not cheap  not even a mediocre meal    maybe the chefs night off    hate to be a downer but the hype was just that  hype  stay  home and throw some rao's on dececco ,negative
oMUBdWkgMD1Yhiyx9-BC9A,i was at this restaurant on sunday march 08  evening for turkish coffee and their box wooden chair on which i was sitting had nail that was not fully fixed and it torn my blue jeans when i told waitress about she first said she was going to tell manager now and went to back office she did not come back to talk to us when i approached her for response she said their manager was not there both waitress said they did not care and it was not their fault they were insensitive and careless so be careful their box chairs have nails which are not fully fixed and can damage and tear your cloths and can hurt your body especially if you go there with children,negative
pg8XTtztUXc-PxRYUVoAvw,i actually cannot write a review about the hotel in their rooms but i can highly discourage you from going to castile the hotel restaurant or roof top 360 we have tried both the rooftop and the restaurant on two separate occasions within a month of each other and both times the experiences were horrible  the view at the rooftop is fantastic but that's where it stops on both experiences the service was terrible and our last experience just last night the bartender didn't even know how to make a cosmopolitan you've got to be kidding me the restaurant was even worse again our second attempt at enjoying a meal it's absolutely atrocious and management needs to get their act together,negative
_Wipq04oW4dwiNcnK9DPTQ,i like the rating scale note for the one star review eek methinks not  my sentiments exactly everything that they offer in the menu is uninspired and a copy of all other generic mediterranean restaurants i do not care for their tomato and mozz sandwich certainly don't care for their hummus or pasta salad  maybe i'm just too high maintenance for the airport because i feel like this food is disgusting and flavorlessthe prices here are also ridiculous and way more than i'm willing to spend for the flavorless food they serve i believe the staff is also just as boring as the food so for that they get a 1 star sorry folks but don't go here if you can avoid it,negative
Hs5p15j2XBXoaPYFcKg32g,my family and i had dinner here while on family vacation and we were not impressed the service was very slow which normally wouldn't bother me if the food was good but that was not the case i've honestly had better italian food from the frozen section of my grocery store our waiter was very inattentive failing to ask if the food was ok if we needed anything else or if our half eaten plates needed to be boxed up he was too busy complaining about the owner and the amount of time his job takes away from his family this restaurant isn't terrible it's mediocre at best,negative
8fCovWo4TJKpdOJ0KCZOIg,i would have probably given sinbad's a higher review but noticed that they are not honoring the groupon i purchased thank goodness for yelp's reviewer who mentioned that they got all the way down there just a few days ago to find that they are not honoring the deal if i hadn't looked at yelp first i would have been in the same position i called sinbad's and they said they are not taking the groupon and to call groupon,negative
oMUBdWkgMD1Yhiyx9-BC9A,have been wanting to try this seemingly great restaurant​ in our neighborhood  we eat and cook turkish and greek etc as husband is  native greek we had high hopes as i sometimes need a break from cooking the place​ is very pretty and inviting we ordered out as they don't serve wine and it was a long work day for me we had reasonable expectations as restaurant​ fare can sometimes be a far cry from homemade ethnic we ordered lamb biryani baba ganoush dolma and the lentil soup to try a few thingswhat could go wrong with the basics well the baba ganoush was bitter and gooey not a good start the soup was touted to be red lentils bulgar rice ​tomato and mint with turkish​h spices sounded warm kinda chunky and satisfying for a mildly​ hungry tired girl on her feet all day hmmmno lentils bulgar  or mint presentjust some thin red boring brothy stuff with a few lackadaisical​  spices and a little broken rice yuck the dolmas for which i get rave reviews about mine from his discriminating family were absolutely lackluster​ gelatinous rice with not a spice or herb even hinted at stuffed into bite size wimpy vegetables a simple tomato and herbscented​ sauce would have gone a long way​ to give them a little life lastly the lamb tasty to be fair but not a generous offering for​ the price over a slightly too sweet rice combination of minced carrots raisins or maybe currents given their size chickpeas spiced with chili and cardamom​ and a little parsley not too bad actually but not fabulous either and then the accompany​ing bread pretty big flat disc of flour and water but no salt which it sorely needed a very hohum​ meal and at 40 including a tip will not be repeated ever in spite of the obvious beauty and charm of the place additionally​ my 'server's' math was a little bewildering it took me three times to explain​ his shortage in my change at least it inspired me to make sumac za'taar grilled chicken in lemon with green beans and toasted pine nuts and walnuts along with roasted paprika​spiced lemony onions good eating to all and good luck sheesh,negative
w0OBYjoFdChfFDsP6f1KYg,not a place for dinner for your family way too expensive and wierd menu you get a 4 course meal for 56pp or 5 course meal for 64pp they say you can share your meal with your friends you hardly get anything for each course not my type of restourantbtw here is a private message for all you brunchstershttpmobilenytimescom20141011opinionsundaybrunchisforjerkshtmlreferrerr0,negative
2j_DISg7fi2FCr5B2Xz9fg,went here over the holidays with my family and was very disappointed to see the chef not wearing a mask throughout the evening chef touched his nose several times and continued to cook completely ruined my experience at savor and will not be attending again during the pandemic,negative
uZYBF0YTU_iKq4_L_PDtMQ,so let me start off by saying i have come to this restaurant three times now and every time i come i have an even worse experience recently i waited 15 hours for a table for three on a monday nightthey sit us down finally and neglect to bring us water or a drink menu for about ten minutes our waitress drops the menus off and walks away before i could ask a question i get up to tell the hostess that we would like a hookah menu and she proceeds to tell me last call for hookah was 5 minutes ago frazzled i walk away in awe at how unprofessional the whole night is handled the waitress agreed to let us buy the hookahtakes forever to arrive it's now 945 and we have yet to order our food at this point i contemplate on leaving our food arrives and is sub par as soon as we pay and leave my husband vomits all over the street he got food poisoning from the undercooked chicken since the restaurant was rushing to get us out after we waited almost 2 hours to eat they neglected to check what they were serving mind you their prices are pretty high absolutely stunned at how rude unprofessional and terrible the staff is,negative
D2igy5Aexgdk8d-DV2K1vw,the servers here are horrible i watched them threaten to beat a girl because she had a canned drink in her purse i believe it was her birthday and instead of celebrating with her they called her a broke bit and had security throw her out they also called the police on the girl as they threatened to assault her i believe the servers name was amy i would rank this bar a infinity after this experience frankly the event i saw tonight was much like the many events portrayed on social media where a young woman is abused and mistreated instead of being treated like a human being,negative
e2RBDxidD3rNQuGvJLHmpw,first this place is difficult to find it's located inside of a gas station without a sign indicating so this was my first red flag but i proceeded to order anywayi ordered the beef shawarma with fries when i placed the order the cashiercook looked confused and had to refer to the menu to see the ingredients my wrap entailed this was red flag number 2 but i still decided to give this place a shotface forward i finally received my food after being the only customer and waiting for 20 minutes  to my dismal the food was nothing as expected or described on the menu the menu claims the beef shawarma includes marinated slices of beef shoulder tender over a bed of lettuce with tomato sumac onion mix and pickles with tahini instead i received overly salted beef with a couple of green bell peppers and some creamy thick paste that was not tahini there was no lettuce tomato sumac onion mix or pickles to top it off it was wrapped in an awful fennel seed tortillanot pita i would have sent the food back but i didn't have time to wait another 20 minutes for a likely improperly prepared meal the wrap was inedible and ended up throwing it awayneedless to say i do not recommend this establishment and i will never return again,negative
OW4FSNBq3UAzC6gUK_xDGw,my spouse and i both ordered pasta seafood dishes the waitress not only knew little about the menu but acted like she did not want to be there  we both asked for spicey marinara sauce  my spouses dish was fine and while i love spice my dish was not edible  i have never sent a dish back before because it was too spicy but had little choice as it smelled like they dumped a jar of cayenne pepper in it  the waitres gave me a hard time about taking it back and neither apologized nor offered to redo the dish   she came back a few minutes later and said they would make me another dish but i declined as i had lost faith in both her and the kitchen at that point i told them i would not use my groupon and would just pay for my spouses meal  my groupon expired a few weeks later and i lost 30  the experience shows that it's critical to hire the right people on both sides of the resturaunt  we have visited floga bistro close to 29 times but after that experience and losing 30 will likely avoid it going forward,negative
rHLjiwjgXOZ7xVUoT1wd9w,i'm that person  this doesn't even deserve a one star when you order food and 15 hours later it arrives and it's still coldto asking the wait staff for a manager a dozen timesto the manager yelling at the wait staff that he does not have time to talk to our partyto basically a yelling matchi'd say that's considered beyond crap for service and food in other words  we won't be back,negative
0mijbNf-7wiKJ9xto1pAyg,spice finch serves up good mediterranean food albeit at high prices and with very risqué decor choiceswe came here as a large group for restaurant week and we feasted on many of the different items in the menu they were all delicious and wellprepared portion sizes are a bit smaller so beware if you're super hungry but if you have just a normal hunger level and want something fancier then the food here will pleasethe biggest detractor for me was the fact that there were literally sex scenes covering the entire wall i found that incredibly inappropriate and it turned me off the experience for that reason alone i don't plan on returningso if you're looking for expensive but good mediterranean food then spice finch has what you want  though you'll need to either get takeout or be comfortable with pornographic wallpaper if you want to enjoy it,negative

GU8Qq1UpVEStKkNRYe-BZw,after looking forward to eating here for several weeks since their exceptional rating from indianapolis monthly my wife and i were sorely disappointed the service was good but the food flavor and texture was poser at best   we ordered the green salad duck confit buns and shrimp and grits the salad lacked seasoning and had what appeared to be store bought sesame seed sticks and puff dried soy beans for garnish the dressing lacked any depth but it looked nice the duck confit buns with pickled ginger were a big disappointment the confit was stuffed in what looked like a yeast bun from your local grocery store it lacked texture and again very little flavor and too sweet the grits that came with the shrimp and grits was done well the pork belly could have been rendered substantially more and the shrimp was undercooked having grownup in south carolina shrimp country i understand that most places way overcook shrimp but this shrimp hadn't even turned pink yet the sauce that was served with the shrimp tasted like canned brown sauce and again no texture except for the raw shrimp and the flavor depth was one dimensional at best nice atmosphere wait staff and it's nice to go to a place outoftheway but downtown i would probably eat here again if black market put more effort into developing their foods' textures and flavor profiles,negative

dA3gSTHqKDWU_OAW98wOmA,a great location and a hopeful menu yet these promising attributes were overwhelmed by lackadaisical service and unimpressive food i stopped in around 1230 or so and found the place nicely populated with diners but not what i'd call bustling i placed an order from what appeared to be their standard lunch menu but it took 25 minutes to arrive when i needed to pay my bill i had to get up and walk to the bar to get the attention of the serverlet me be clear the servers were very pleasant and chatty no trouble there just a bit inattentive combined with slow food preparation my lunch selection of chicken kabobs was tasty enough served on skewers with vegetables the hummus however was bland and had a consistency of baby food isis has plenty good competition nearby for the lunch crowd i recommend shoring up food quality and service to compete with the others,negative
38yHZCHWgPZlDj5SqdNcpA,literally the worst pizza i've ever had in my life it was delivered half smooshed on the top of the box and cold don't even get me started on the garlic knots couldn't even chew it the marinara sauce is more like salsa never order from here,negative
vz7-mdYrOSnpeWvncE5eUQ,this place was just so so i definitely wouldn't describe it as greek since most options were american   the gyro was just ok  it was a little dry and they were skimpy on the meat also the pita was unusual i would pass on this restaurant,negative
iZyQrpnxfCbgOf6XXEIuBQ,ordered a stromboli and calzone through uber eats based off of the reviews we figured this would be their specialty they were both raw 40 later and uber eats and the restaurant did nothing will have to file a chargeback with my bank this is absolutely not okay do not waste your time and money,negative
XjjgJb0iyG33CQp4ehnRGQ,warning this place is  look at review dates before making a decision based on yelp reviewsso based upon yelp reviews one of my best friends and i went to an early birthday dinner and i decided to go to jamila because we both like mediterranean food and when i saw the rating and reviews i said this was a great new place for me to try the first warning was that it was a saturday night on a holiday weekend and there was hardly anyone in the place i was shocked and disappointed by this place the food was massively overpriced and lackluster we ordered the appetizer of mussels and i thought at 10 that it would be a big bowl enough for two like most places that are supposed to be on this level it was a little dish that i could have devoured in less that five minutes the entrees were nothing more that a lamb stew that was not worth the 23 price tag by any means it was my birthday meal and it was mentioned to the owner and no customary free dessert like you would get at most restaurants at this level i can see this joint not being around that long,negative
6RRw-xi_Qepj_ziwW-Rg3g,the olive branch has been on my list for west chester for a while now due to the great looking menu and reviews however i was not impressed normally when i go to a tapas restaurant i expect to pay high prices and be wowed by sophisticated bites bursting with flavor  not here the atmosphere  relaxing vibe with spread out tables and outdoor section when weather permits the food   the menu is full of seasonal tapas that are constantly changing which may be the issue  too many constantly changing dishes not enough time to perfect them  i went in with high expectations and was disappointed the lobster mac and cheese which i have read rave reviews about was horrible the cheese looked curdled and was a watery texture i stopped eating it after two bites the garlic shrimp while seemingly healthy including a tomato and white bean base were flavorless and had no hint of garlic 4 shrimp for 13 was no bueno the apple brie and bacon flatbread looked amazing but again was ok it was hard to eat because the apple slices were so big on top and the cheese was gouging over the edges i also had the the skirt steak lettuce wraps and grilled thai spice tuna  both were flavorful and cooked well but not enough to make up for the rest of my review the service   our server was nice and attentive the downside was we were there for 25 hours for 5 tapas the wait was ridiculous for each dish to arrive to the table understandably it was a saturday night but the restaurant was not full there was no wait to get in parking  you can park in any of the west chester public lots or on the street there is no parking lot as it is in the heart of downtown wc  price  not worth the money overall all the prices are similar to other tapas style restaurants i wouldn't say overpriced but i was not impressed by the service food or experience,negative
Q2mR4I8LdkYE-Tw7_-s-vw,aside from a family that was cashed out i was the only other party in the restaurant i went up to the ipad register which apparently wasn't working correctly but was told that my order a hummus pita with no egg was verbally placed i waited over twenty minutes before leaving 3 to 5 is the slowest time in restaurants please do not forget about your customers will not return,negative
AmNiOh4k1DLdpsuPUeo9Sw,went there last night and had horrible service  we got our appetizers after waiting 1 hour for them   manger offered to comp the appetizers  they were good waited another hour and entrees never arrived  we got up and walked out  and as we were leaving manager offered  to give us our dinners to go why if they were ready to go why we weren't they served if you decide to go after this review i would recommend you eat before you go,negative
qVitsouI4aBiYx1_Fjn0Pg,dress code isn't consistent between men and women if you don't have proper jeans as a dudeany rip you will be rejected as a women that will be tolerated if you can sell yourself you will be allowed otherwise you will be rejected,negative
MSKQTsQvBKfLRtkni9icSA,first time trying out this restaurant the food was great but the customer service was lacking we were told to order and pay immediately before receiving our food at the front whereas other older white couples and at least a party of 5 or so were waited on at their table and didn't have to pay until they were ready to leave which i found odd since there was a serveri'm not sure if it was racial discrimination since we were the only latin americans but i saw at least 3 caucasian groups who did not pay until the end of their meal and their orders were taken by their table also service was extremely slow we didn't receive our appetizers until we were leaving we told the server that we had yet to receive it it was not until we got up to check on it that they were barely placing it in the oven at least 1015min later after we spoke with the server even though we enjoyed the food we won't be returning since the overall experience on how they did not attend customers equally and making it seem like it was our fault for not receiving our appetizer until we were leaving,negative
QFXLQf2Z680nmzMp2ah0jA,i work right around the corner and used to eat here quite frequently last night ate here for dinner and was truly disappointed everything was off except for the tea i had the veggie plate and partner had schwarma sandwich neither of us was happy i had a stomach ache to boot later in the evening probably will not go back,negative
7wV_V6snbNZPRyQz5FADfg,the worst dining service i've ever experience i was nearby so decided to try some mediterranean food the service is really slow we were waiting almost 20 minutes just to have some water the food isn't good the smell of the meat isn't good too the rice is hard make my stomach feel bad when i was eating i think the price is high for a singe dish also the restaurant is dirty and the owner is rude don't waste your time here i won't come back,negative
D2igy5Aexgdk8d-DV2K1vw,we have been going to the one on elliston place for 8 years last night the one on elliston was full so we went to their location on belcourt the place was nicely decorated and the hookah was good  but the service was awful anytime we wanted a drink or needed new coals we had to go to the bar and ask for itwe left a 1 star review and said to visit the one on elliston place insteadtoday we went to the one on elliston place to buy hookah tobacco but was informed we were banned unless we removed our review and spoke to the owners  how about no instead of banning your regulars how about you train you staff to give better customer service,negative
uZYBF0YTU_iKq4_L_PDtMQ,the first time i went i had a good experience the staff was friendly and informative however my second visit was a different story we asked for a hookah table and they staff did not give us a menu and rushed us to order as soon as we sat down the man told us that there was a a minimum of 15 per person to share a hookah when we informed the guy that we came here a little bit ago and the hookah was 25 and refil was 12 and we weren't charged 15 per person so 30 on top of a 25 hookah  he said he worked there for 6 years and that it was a policy he seemed unsure of what he was telling us don't think i'll return,negative
WNhcS2zi4zAqA2TbduVINQ,this place is a rip off i was overcharged and swindled 48 at a quick serve restaurant for a meal for two do not go here this is my first yelp review had to say something because it was that much of a rip off,negative
pglnZLI7LJZhONgdFgi0og,i've been to this place several times in the past mostly because it's very close to where i live several years ago a friend and i went in very close to closing time and they served me 12 raw chicken wings because the fryer had been turned off too early they claim to serve st louisstyle thin crust but the deluxe we had the other night was sadly lacking in spices and in toppings a deluxe should feature at least 5 toppings and they should be piled on the sauce should have at least garlic and oregano and talayna's sauce tasted like it was just tomato paste this place is a franchise that was purchased from the late mike talayna faille who owned the original at the corner of skinker  forest park i would strongly suggest that the owners of this franchise visit places like ponticello's faraci's farotto's pirrone's angelo's frankie tocco's or any imo's to see what a real deluxe st louis style pizza should look and taste like don't let the nostalgia of the name fool you there are much better pies to be had in st louis,negative
KbKuKzmbdzdfrRwgAE6EGw,we were so disappointed with this restaurant  our waiter was incompetent too forever and the restaurant wasn't even busy  he kept giving us bad information about things being gluten free and then took 15 min to get back to our table to tell us that he was wrong that item was not gluten free we would need to choose another entree  we were starving by the time we got our dinners which were under cooked  the veggies were so raw we couldn't cut them  the waiter brought my husband some asparagus instead and guess what  that was just as raw  also the portions were small  the waiter then offered to bring us a gluten free strawberry shortcake made with polenta  sounded very yummy  okay  15 min later he comes back with no shortcake to tell us it wasn't gluten free after all  another disappointment  he suggested the berry triffle  we finally got that 10 min later it was a soupy mess of runny pudding in a martini glass w2 strawberries and one raspberry on top  you should have seen it  oh it had the tiniest dollop of whipped cream on top too  it was a pitiful dessert  looked like a 5 year old put it together in a kindergarten class for mommy  we were dining here for the first time from out of town and this place was highly recommended to us by the hotel staff  what a waste,negative
_Wipq04oW4dwiNcnK9DPTQ,horrible service employees are too busy gossiping to even notice customers waiting to have their order taken choose another restaurant,negative
GRSS2xFmaiX6hw7QReoM_g,shawarmageddon may offer solid food but the service leaves much to be desired upon entering we heard the employees yell at each other to tone it down as customers were there they continued to blast music and cuss loudly at each other i realize this concept doesn't give the indication it's a calm and quiet operation but it was a bit much after ordering we waited almost twenty minutes in an otherwise empty restaurant before we found every employee outside taking a break our food made and waiting inside they had forgotten to hand it over and left the music blaring while they headed outside an honest mistake perhaps but pretty inexcusable complimentary tea was offered as an apology which was appreciatedthe food itself was mixed as the tabbouleh and falafel were only mildly seasoned and severely lacking herbs the pickled veggies and sauces however were flavorful and buoyed the meal they offer three sauces per entree and i'd suggest to take advantage of that offer the teas were also much more mild than i expected from such an inyourface concept and while the donuts were a fun finish to the meal they were rather bland without the orange blossom frosting shawarmageddon succeeds at sauces but should spread some seasoning to the bulk of the meal and until service is improved i don't think i'll be returning,negative
A1XtRuSxZW7sYnV-ab0RlA,very few restaurants deserve a 5 star rating and very few a one starthis is one of those rare exceptions  amateur wait staff was forgivable but the food  overcooked and undercooked and that was for the same vegtable on the same plate  nothing was hot some freezing cold  first time in a very long time i sent something back to the kitchendon't think they'll be in town very long despite the attractive looking decor from the street,negative
wr4tUYkhdlWs6HJNbiipSg,we visited for dinner last week  the service was good maybe a 4  but i'm giving the overall rating based on value  we had a party of 4 and i think the overall consensus was that it was ok but not memorable  the entrees were about 20 and higher  for that price i expected a little more than basic fried shrimp  maybe the other dishes on the menu were better but i can only judge based on ours  over 100 for a family of 4 for dinner i probably would try another restaurant next time  i can see paying extra if we had a great view but this is on the main street with lots of traffic,negative
QCPUoVbzkTAu1gkCrZlPaQ,this was the third visit for my rocker boy and i last night we found ourselves craving zaatarit was an abysmal experience our past 2 visits were wonderful our food was well prepared succulent perfectly spiced and satisfying our experience this visit was a complete 180° from those and judging by the more recent reviews we're not alonei ordered the chicken schwarma plate and my partner ordered spicy beef atop hummus plate the dining area wasn't busy and there was a to go ordered placed ahead of us we watched as several take away orders were filled before our food was ever started i watched as the cook put a preportioned bag of chicken into a pan where it cookedand cookedand cooked by the time i got my chicken schwarma it had become little curved crusts of dried out unflavorful jerkyno buenomy guys spicy beef and hummus was tasty but there wasn't any dressing on his salad and while my salad had dressing there was only two minuscule pieces of feta on it perhaps an 8th of a teaspoons worth our pitas had absolutely no flavor and tasted stale strange because they bake their own breadi don't think we'll be back which is sad because we really enjoyed our first two visits,negative
2HxkdqHmbYGj_BH1bLaiSw,2 covid fee over a year later is kind of crazy showed up early for our lunch res and we're still told about the 90 minute covid limit service was mediocre tamale had zero taste yelp reviews made this place look so good so i was very disappointed,negative
S2n_06z4lGLZfdJ53XAXQQ,my boyfriend and i went there for a special occasion  the atmosphere is just ok and so is the food  we were disappointed  the service was good  the server was sweet and quick  my food was cold and neither of our meals were good  he had duck and i had scollops  the plating presentation is impressive and the salads look good but we didn't get a salad  we were looking forward to trying etch but won't be back,negative
KQHqDPUaAd4412_6vbRk0g,i don't know if i'm just spoiled when it comes to mediterranean food or what but this place is subpar to the fullest meaning of the term tabouli made my throat scratchy because it was so dry and i'm not sure who taught these guys how to make shawarma but this is definitely not it over seasoned falafel tasted like pure cumin i asked forextra pickles and lemon on the side and didn't receive either if you need your arabic fix and can't find anywhere else the hummus is good and the grape leaves were edible if you have other options skip pita republic and head there totally disappointed,negative
o3ca5qJSorYBJCK-S7bVsw,we are a group of seven retirees who decided to try le gourmet for breakfast today don't judge this restaurant by its strange website errors don't judge it by the beautiful atmosphere that greets you when you first walk in don't judge it by the very good service and attention that you will no doubt be given however judge it by its food and drink we all agreed that their home fries were some of the best we have eaten in our weekly breakfasts that we have had in the bucksmontgomery area however that is where the good news ends the six of us who had coffee agreed that there was a funny taste to it some of us thought it was chemical most of us agreed that it was very weak andor watered down the omelettes were a beautiful yellow with no brown on them at all but unfortunately that is where the goodness ended all seven omelettes were definitely very very watery as if they had added water to extend the number of eggs they were using our friend with the ham and cheese omelette couldn't eat past his first bite this restaurant speaking only about breakfast could be the finest in the area i think some of us are willing to try lunch or dinner there as those menus seemed superb some of us might try breakfast again in a few months to see if anything has improved as far as their website they might fix it up but that isn't as important as fixing up breakfast,negative
GRSS2xFmaiX6hw7QReoM_g,i wish they never called it shawerma it is not an authentic shawerma taste and it's a wanna be will never be going there again,negative
7kfDejB49x7MVbeffykoDw,i guess i didn't realize this was a greek seafood place  we were looking for a seafood place on the water during our visit to palm harbor we didn't really have greek in mind  anyway the atmosphere was a bit icky and my husband's draft beer glass had sand in it  that being said the food was okay  i loved the pita bread appetizer and i opted for a gyro and it was quite good  i wouldn't go back however,negative
TpLyNlRVcXREIw-94yOIaw,was craving some greek food so stopped by based on yelp reviews specifically ordered no sauce on the shawarma walk home 9 blocks in 95 degree weather so not walking back to find it smothered in sauce its in the trash along with my money,negative
czZ39uUtw3Z1eRvHpDg2yA,dirty and rude workers  they argue with you about serving wrong food  so bad management,negative
wa_bwyY57etHjtJ2Fw0E3g,1 star for customer service 4 stars for quality not 5 because portion was truly not comparable to price for customer serviced i prefer the one on oracle,negative
gdDUtIhG4tTshh2LbpfMfQ,had a gyro once and it was ok so thought i would give it another go  shawarma and shish touok chicken this time  threw it away  the rice was minute rice with some corn and peas in it  terrible and getting harassed by the street folk begging for cigs and money in front and inside the place is also not a plus  the guy at the counter was nice at least will never go back,negative
ALK-7tTvDKAzxAtIiNyh2A,i heard great things about this restaurant so we decided to try it we both ordered a pasta dish and they were both extremely salty in addition to that we waited forever to get them so we just ate it rather than wait another hour for food,negative
ihL_QVjG98BdPtD6_bVuuQ,it's the day before 4th of july most people are off work how many people are working at this restaurant on this national holiday one one server  who is also manning the bar greeting new diners getting the food out from the kitchen bringing drinks condiments checks etc  waited an hour for food will never come back here,negative
xRapA2lG7mjJ6eOqHmxe-A,wonderful location but food not very good cold service not great and overpriced for what you get,negative
_393npnr0Dw1aGKy83x_0A,we went in for a brunch that lasted forever and nearly starved i know many reviews given low is due to service but i have to emphasize to whoever runs this place that service needs some checks and balances it took at least 2030 minutes once sat after a 2030 wait to order anything the food then took prob 451 hr food was placed in front of me and then taken back then food dropped for my friends and mine took another 5 minutes the food didn't all come at once we had sides that came after that very unapologetic and careless service too the food was above average but fairly expensive for the quantity and surely not worth that wait maybe this is a rare experience but has to be warned for others,negative
o6XeJY-d8Bsphhc-CbtFAQ,my boyfriend and i went here because i purchased a groupon for a wine tasting with appetizers when we first walked in i was confused about where to go the staff were hard to distinguish from the other guests after wandering around confused for a little while we were sat down and the groupon special was explained to us i was so confused  after hearing the explanation that i had to guess from the other tables as to what to do the wine was good but the service was absolutely terrible we had to get up and request the next sample of wine from the counter in the back of the bistro then we realized that we should have gotten our food at the beginning so again i walked over to the counter and requested the sampler included in our groupon the salami and cheese were good but the oysters which we got on a recommendation from one of the servers were awful they were served in a can and were extremely stinky and sandy i will admit that i have never had oysters before but this was not what i was expecting i sent the can back because i couldn't take the smell at the barrel we were sat at also when the menu says half of a ciabatta they literally mean a roll of ciabatta bread cut in half and expected to share between two people the wine was good and it was a good experience but i will not return it's understandable that it's a new place just starting out but the owners really need to establish a structure for service,negative
rfsjwsB9ACTQ-FESh47iUw,please yelp allow people to leave zero stars  this was a horrible let downwe came based in yelp reviews and that we travelled to turkey and enjoy the food tremendously not here however terrible service and dry food were in order for our eveningthe waiter was bizarre in his mannerism staring at us and then walking away took 10 minutes to get the menu and water in this matchbox of a restaurant then when we wanted to order it took another 15 minutes even though we kept trying to get his attention there were three maybe four other tables and two other waitstaff so it was def not busy weird how he would look  at us and then away even when we wanted the check the food was terrible their borek phyllo wrapped cheese sticks didn't have any cheese in them literally a smudge of feta maybe  the iskender dish was a gross mess of sauce and gyros that tasted like ketchup i've had this dish in istanbul so i know better too bad they didn'tthe combo plate was dry and bland complete waste we didn't finish or wrap the leftover of which there was plentyso so sorry we wasted good money and a night in indy at this dump hated leaving the tip for the weirdo dude too,negative
uZYBF0YTU_iKq4_L_PDtMQ,some of the food is good others not so much  the first time i went the service wasn't great the last time i went the service was horrible the busboy came over and took my food way before i was done i couldn't get it back because he had stack plates together i had to ask repeatably for some items and the server never brought them and there were only 2 other tables being serviced on the patiodeck area i think in the future if i do eat here again i'm ordering takeout so i can actually get a chance to eat my food,negative
WDm-Z705Wp93k-46PN_g9Q,very disappointed in my order overall one item did not come with a side of roasted potatoes as stated on the menu also the delivery driver pretended not to have change when i said i only had a 10 bill for a tip i close the door and magically a five dollar bill appeared out of nowhere it's basically left me no option other than to tip him five dollars or give him nothing that is a terrible position to put your customer in if you want them to have a good experience neither of these were enough to make up for the food which was actually fairly good but because of the two shortcomings i will never be eating here againeditadded a star because that is the best tiramisu i've ever had,negative
t3e9gRPMSRqVlvmK3VJQSw,if i were to guess the rim of my wine glass was rubbed underneath a sweaty man's armpits before being brought to our table if almost throwing up every time i took a sip wasn't enough the food made me lose any ounce of an appetite i had leftthe pita bread was thinner than scott's toilet paper and the falafel almost broke my two front teeth  everything tasted like overcooked freezer food i've had far better mediterranean from costco samplers and deter anyone from going to eat here,negative
ar5Rw-bQ8oN9Omt_EQaEOg,terrible service i wish i could give 0 stars it took over two hours to receive our order and we are 17 miles away the delivery driver and someone from the restaurant called us and we gave extremely clear instructions on how to find our apartment turn into the complex turn left take the first right and we are at the end with a yellow door white wreath etc other delivery drivers find our apartment with ease we had to call the restaurant several times with no answer and when we were finally answered we learned the driver returned with our food and someone else was delivering it the attached pictures show my calls to the restaurant at 256 i had already been waiting for our order placed at 145 that's when i was told a new person was delivering at 333  i called back and was put on hold for 12 minutes until another person called and still couldn't find our apartment we then waited another 10 minutes for that person to arrive edit the owner called and offered a full refund for our trouble they could be an okay business if they improve quality of their food and employees' customer service,negative
mJYm5ronkSp2hDI71rdKxQ,i would recommend that their drive through only include coffee and pastries we sat in line for 30 mins and when we were told to park and wait the worker walked outside and went back in without even looking for us when we finally got our food we were made to feel like it was our fault they 'couldn't find us' customer service should be a focus area for this business,negative
TzkVUJab9Sh0CqDk2sCF-w,so i get invited by a friend to eat at the famous bayona one of the restaurants that i have been meaning to try just always forget to make the reservationwe get there get seated and there is some type of argument going on at the table next to usobviously belligerent drunk guy is yelling and cussing at the table next to him calling the women cnt  and the all sorts of ridiculousnesshis girlfriend is alternating between loudly calming him down and whispering things to egg him onthe other table is obviously ignoring himnormally i wouldn't hold this against the establishment after all this is the french 14 but after 10 minutes of listening to this not only does the management do nothing but as we are leaving we walked out before eating or drinkingi was going to kill this punk if he talked to my wife that way my host a regular remarks to me that he is absolutely certain the girlfriend egging this moron on is an employee of the place a bartender or waitressshame on you chef spicer your piss poor management and staff are pathetic i hope you make as much tourist money as possible because i can assure you that this will not be tolerated by us localsi will not return and i can assure you that no one i ever talk to will want to come here,negative
D2igy5Aexgdk8d-DV2K1vw,terrible horrible bouncer stick to the original i was carded i'm 41 and was told i had to leave due to having on a muscle shirt on yet a lady walked in with a tank top on nothing said discrimination at its best,negative
BmKCJsV_payJ5ANqC7i85g,i love this restaurant and would normally give 45 starts but i had a very unsatisfactory experience tonight my wife and i showed up for dinner slightly before 9 we waited at the desk for a few minutes without anyone acknowledging us though they saw us come in then once i finally got someone's attention they told me that they were closed for the evening even though their published hours show that they are open until 10 pm we came out on this cold night especially to dine at the vine but were denied i'll have to think twice about coming back next time,negative
fRKTd27NSZ_WE09s8dHUwg,food is terrible to the point of not being edible buffalo chicken sandwich was completely soggy from being doused in too much mayo and buffalo sauce and the chicken itself was tougher than rubber even though i was hungry i threw the sandwich away i wouldn't give this to a dog not sure how this place is still in business,negative
lstgSw6ejDzZRZLf446x8Q,awful service the food seemed old certainly not fresh i will not repeat the same mistake again,negative
AZsVCKIWWVE1T8IlFVfcKA,this was the first time ordering from here and i think it will be the last time i'm sorry but i really didn't think tonight was all that great first of all the hot sauce was pretty hot it was hot enough to make the meal unenjoyable this location was out of onions how do you run out of onions i really was excited to try this place but it really fell short to me it just seems like another chain that doesn't care about the customer i added extra baba ganoush to both platters and all i got was a tbsp and a half of baba and they gave my wife hummus i'm sorry but there a few more places around more authentic for a cheaper price and better quality food sorry but i won't try again,negative
2DTkzhmMpv5fIPKheePClA,i guess i'm not yuppie enough to think this is good the restaurant has a very sheik atmosphere i really was wanting it to be good it was very different the pita was warm and homemade but thick and fluffy not what i think of when i think pita bread the food wasn't awful just really different it's kinda like a hey we live in uptown so we have to eat swanky food type of place,negative
28RE5-9vhE6cPxldHVM_ug,i waited six weeks before coming to give them time to work out any fresh opening issues they had because no one is perfect we got there and were seated in a concrete floor cream walled cafeteriabanquet room there was one other table of six and it was so loud i couldn't hear to have a conversation at all i can t imagine when it's busy you can hear kitchen noises they have volume from the tv's in the dining area and in the bar i felt like i was back in another country with all the stimuli and not in a good way i ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich on a hoagie and my guest had the plt the pork belly version of their blt with two side garden salads the salads are on chilled plates with radish onion and tomato and some dressing that was supposed to be a viniagrette we didn't get any flavor and it literally was a plate of wet lettuceentree's came and my veggie hoagie only had flavor from the butter on the hoagie which if you're vegan essentially can only eat wet lettuce here there was no offer of aoli ranch or cheese i took two bites hoping but it was terrible even some evoo salt and pepper would have gotten this vegetarian to like it i was so hungry so i thought i'd eat just about anything that is how awful it wasmy guest had the pork belly which were several slices of poorly cooked pork and some thick and thin that were most all grisel and so much aoli that the sandwich was a pool of soggy disgustingnessbaklava was one layer but the presentation was nice the waitress i told i hope they took my comment constructively because i do wish them well and it would be a great addition to the neighborhood if they got their shit together and decided what they want to do and execute it well we have pizza and sandwiches that are amazing all around and for much cheaper atmosphere boring and loud food disgusting service was okay our waitress was nice enough the space was not tacky but presentation is only a small part of the experience i probably won't be back but if you want help i'd say know your audience and have specials for days and drinks and get people in once you revamp your entire menu or you won't last,negative
MXNEFOi2wO8Zk6s5-5yaEw,the food used to be really good but literally every single time i get food to go they mess up my order they will not include things or get the order wrong i worked in the restaurant industry for over a decade and this is completely unacceptable i have stopped recommending this restaurant to my friends and family because in the last ten times i have ordered food they have messed it up every single time today they left out all my dipping sauces and my grass fed burger is literally uncooked in the middle  it is raw in the middle and burned on the outside last time they forgot an entire entree and i had to wait longer for it i'm probably never going back which is a shame because when your food is done correctly it is good but good luck getting your food done correctly if you order from here triple check your food because they employees won't,negative
dkhIHaqr3DqOoTsqTLeUPA,when a place like this opens soon after a similar restaurant closes it is supposed to mimic the place that closed it did not and it is not even that good either avoid at all costs,negative
c5w3gViEODLmPJBCeAVUIQ,byblos is an interesting hookah bar if you have nothing better to do why not try it out grab a table in this strangely and poorly decorated place be ready to people watch to the loud music that doesn't fit in the waitresses are nice enough but really too busy to care so you better hail someone down when your coal nearly burns out hookah prices are a lil high and you are forced to buy drinks definitely not my goto but might be worth a visit if you have absolutely nothing else to do,negative
5s7I0Khg7ReVzfO7niJtKg,so for mom's day my husband says what special meal would you like tonight dear i think oooh how about more of that wonderful meditteranean food we had at the zayna in tanque verdebut the speedway location is much closer so lets go there wrong choice the food was average no special minty sprinkles on the kifta which we paid extra  to be lamb but they skimped us and gave us beef instead no fries with the sandwich even though the menu says we get 'em and one or two sesame seeds on the overcooked hard cold falafel instead of the sesame seed crusted crispy tender balls we got at the other zayna what a huge disappointment as a former restaurant worker my guess is that the owner spends more time at the tv location leaving the cooks time to slack at the speedway spot i feel that my trust was betrayed here by indifferent cooking i won't eat here again owner i hope you read these reviews if you have two babies you gotta pay them equal attention don't let a potentially loyal customer like me down ,negative
JGVxKGvQEaMZ6O_2l0UucA,i was not impressed my family wanted to go there for a late lunch during the restaurant's 22nd anniversary special we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated at 130 on a friday  which is not a big deal the problem was that it was another 10 minutes to see a waiter order placed and it takes 20 minutes to get salad served  oh and they served soup at the same time then it was another 25 minutes to get the entrees served the whole time the waiter is off doing whatever but certainly wasn't around to our table i waited tables for years and cannot imagine being in hiding like that food was fine  i got a shrimp creole which was more like a shrimp goulash it was tasty but certainly had nothing creole about it perhaps people in nj just expect bland foods,negative
tYkgqLuWjmgP6OE4hhHkRA,when i visit a new place any place really i want to feel like they want me to be there if they don't fight for my business  i'll gladly take my hard earned  somewhere elsethe place itself is awesome  the outside tables are open and welcoming but the wait staff is not first time i came here i ordered hookah and a gyro sandwich the sandwich never came despite my two reminders tea also takes about 45 mins to get to the table assuming they made you the right batch to begin withthe hookah is over pricedif you order that you don't have to tip especially given the excuse from our elusive waitress that table over there tips big and my manager didnt want to hear any complaintsok guess i'm not tipping or ever coming back,negative
wa_bwyY57etHjtJ2Fw0E3g,i wish i had read the recent yelp reviews before going here for dinner the other night this place is hurting bad for good service and well prepared food after a long hard week of work all i wanted was a nice night out and to enjoy some good food with my fiance that sure did not happen 1 took about 5 minutes for a server come to our table one we were seated the restaurant was not very busy 2 she was not very friendly when she did greet us we got the feeling we were a bother to her right off the bat 3 we ordered the mediterranean platter as an appetizer and the pita seemed stale or overcooked it was certainly not soft 4 i ordered a side of brown rice with my burger and was brought lentils instead i pointed it out to the waitress who blamed the cooks and seemed very annoyed with me for pointing out the mistake first off maybe the cooks did mix up the order but is it not her responsibility to check the correctness of the order before it's brought to the table second when she did bring me the rice it was hard and crunchy completely undercooked5 my fiance ordered the garlic new potatoes to go with his burger and the potatoes were almost all burnt and inedible the ones that weren't burnt didn't taste like garlic what so ever he could have sent them back but after the attitude the waitress gave to me he didn't want to 6 we were not asked if we would like another round drinks or needed anything else after we had started in on our entrees and how could we not want more drinks after such a disappointing dining experience i have never had a bad experience here in the past food and service have always met my expectations however i am not sure i want to return here again anytime soon as it was absolutely not worth the 60 we spent my fiance made a comment that taco bell would have been a better choice for dinner and unfortunately i have to agree,negative
YtjH3oPnx1gZt2dCdUC3tQ,we visited last night granted it was a sunday evening but the place was dead there were guests at two other tables yet it took our waitress ten minutes to even come over and greet us and take our drink order it's not like she was so busy she didn't have time i'm not sure if they have an abbreviated menu on sunday but there was nothing good to choose from their craft beer taps weren't working so we ended up having a miller lite yuck some overpriced gator bites 14 for a handful of bites and left it was depressing like a restaurant you would see on restaurant impossible or bar rescue the place is located in such a neat spot right on the water it's a shame they don't take better advantage of this it seemed like a lot of places were closed down on channelside i would not be surprised if this place closes soon we should have gone to hooters,negative
tuos6bve7ktOER5Fgz71-Q,udo not go here at all  service was horrible waitress took 20 mins to bring a menu keep in mind it was a slow night i ordered a hummus hookah and chicken shwarma wrap and soda the drink tasted water down food was serve with no napkins or utensils hummus was really good hookah was ok waitress forgot to bring the charcoals  after waiting 35 mins for the wrap i decided to see what was taking so long  i went inside and found the waitress eating food and smoking hookah  my food was siting on a plate in front of her cold i decided to take the check and she made a fuss the chief female came out and gave me a hard time to cancel the order very rude and unprofessional do not go here place is a mess ,negative
MSKQTsQvBKfLRtkni9icSA,we're we're excited to try this place  sat there for 30 minutes and finally got our water  did not take our order  very disappointed  worst service ever too bad they just lost some good customers   don't go here,negative

xvTa375IhWkFSiujUI2adg,ordered through uber eats which said the gyro plate came with rice salad and hummus and when it arrived it had old lettuce and i don't even know what they were trying to pass off as hummus super disappointed tziki wasn't good either gyro meat was all right but certainly not good only thing i'll say is that it was fast,negative
S2n_06z4lGLZfdJ53XAXQQ,i was disappointed by etchthe biggest problem was the service was unacceptably slow  our appetizer took about 30 minutes to arrive  our entrees arrived just before the one hour markour server never mentioned anything like your food is coming or sorry for the wait or offered any sort of acknowledgement  is this the norm herethe food was good  the cauliflower appetizer is nice  the okra side is really good with an orange sauce and some feta cheese that complemented it  but generally the food while unique was kind of bland,negative
qVitsouI4aBiYx1_Fjn0Pg,i honestly came here wanting to love it it's a great location a nice atmosphere and a unique menu and i will say that the food was good that's what the star is for apart from that we ordered from the happy hour menu which said it went until 7pm at 630 but the host didnt honor the menu price since she said happy hour actually ended at 6 so the expected price went up from 30 to over 55 we asked if she would honor the menu price and she said no but she did end up giving us 10 off that was nice so we go out to the nice patio and the food comes out pretty quickly but we hadn't gotten our drinks and after eating half of our meal i decided to go in and check on the drinks turns out she totally forgot what we had ordered i waited another 15 minutes watching her tend to maybe two other customers at the bar before she got to our two drinks she then gave us a cocktail that wasn't what we ordered and when we asked about it she claimed that it was right so we drank it we went in to get one more cocktail and she seriously tried to charge us again for the whole meal saying we hadn't paid needless to say the service was horrendous the restauarant has a lot of potential but they have to get more competent waitstaff,negative
vHgtIxUNujLbloMyOMLyEA,i started out giving re three stars but then i saw that they are classified as a tapas restaurantwhich eh not so muchthere was nothing tapas about their menu they had apps and entrees didn't make it to dessert  no fault of theirs we just had a very tired baby with usthe food was mediocre and very heavy on the salt  the service however was excellent  that's all i have to say about that,negative
zS_iBFOBbZSNC1edaijD3A,this was terrible the white sauce was nothing to brag about and i should have known too i read the mediocre reviews and most of them were spot onfriendly service with a smile that's about it the food it's not what i expectedchopped beef for a gyro sandwich did you get that chopped beef normally gyro meat is sliced to order right or wrong plus there is no lamb on the menu what so disappointingfor a quick tasteless bite sure give it a trybut may i suggest just search yelp again there are other choices with better ratings and decent writeupsdo what i do read all or at least most of the reviewsthey say you are your own critic but the reason for yelp reviews is to help find the best place for a memorable dining experience reasonable in price casual with a comfortable atmosphere most importantly food is beyond awesome goodnessregardless of the flavor you have a taste for even the simplest of menus should be worthy for you palette,negative

eA9p9OXvrdQI1J1jxVsRlQ,the restaurant was very clean and great atmosphere very limited menu though just basic vietnamese items as any other place i try to venture out to see if any vietnamese restaurants out there offer something different from others i give this place 5 stars for physical appearance atmosphere  staff but for food they are pretty much as good as anywhere else,positive
iay91CweEOzRIW6wjcOjuA,while the rest of their menu may be unremarkable in the face of the area's concentration of viet food places the pho here is excellent  nothing says authentic southeast asia authenticity like a smokefilled room full of immigrants plus or minus the occasional mouse  real character  really like going to another country,positive

1MbwLxXrQk7H1FOidg8hoA,pho is one of my favorite foods and when me and my family were visiting temple for the first night we were unfamiliar with the area a long day of packing in getting supplies and just getting off of an exhausting airplane trip we found yummy pho and decided to try it what we were served i got the pho tai was delicious it was exactly what we needed and the quality of the food was excellent i recommend eating here if you want a bowl of pho or even a nice serving of any type of vietnamese food,positive
vetEEi-77Mlik9SogwlcFg,the pho is 5 star to be honest i haven't tried anything else here as i just can't get enough of the pho my wife's favorite is the grilled pork vermicelli bowl the friendly service and clean restaurant makes us really enjoy it here and the ridiculously low prices are a bonus,positive
P-TC0VSnUsct3NhYrj5xOA,great place for vietnamese food the price and portion is amazing the layout and decoration of the restaurant is beautiful even when they're busy they're always knocking out all of the orders in a timely manner the bakery area and drink making area is a great idea owner is also very friendly and nice,positive
p9Dd6AjOawHGGzcUntYr-A,disclaimer never dined in my husband and i have always ordered takeout from this place so frequently that they know our order by heart we live less than a block away from the cafe so it is extremely convenient to pick up hot soups on our way back home especially during this long winter so i can't really comment on their service but the food is generally ready within minutes our usual order is tofu curry with vegetable and veggie noodle soup  both the dishes are absolutely fantastic although tofu curry is my personal favorite,positive
sCkBUXw-GrMvRRxcun-Alg,we love fusion bowl  the food is fresh healthy and delicious  parking is on the street but has not been a problem  the place is clean and upbeat be aware of the hours as this is a downtown business and revolves around work hours closes by 5 not open on saturdays but well worth the effort to get there on time,positive
eA9p9OXvrdQI1J1jxVsRlQ,the food is very fresh and food best part is that there isn't any msg the broth is very flavorful but there are too much noodles all in all excellent i will return back,positive
ksFVaF5TatgsVGXk7Yyw9A,first time having pho so nothing to compare it to  visiting my parents in the area and brought them here on the recommendation of family and yelp of course  food was so very tasty  avoided the spring rolls due to reviews but we sampled a couple different bowls  we had the 6 15 and 19  all were wonderful and we spiced them up to our preferences  the cafe sua da was heaven and i would go back just for that  cannot beat the prices especially considering the amount of foodmy parents are hooked and will be back i will definitely go with them when in the area again,positive

Rx5lfHMWkezmQjCfr2ziAw,so i've been feeling pretty under the weather the last couple of days and one of my cures is my mom's chicken soup my mom lives in iowa so i'm pretty sol on that front so i thought of the next best thing yaka mein earlier this year i had switched my jazz fest food craving from the overpriced sliver of crawfish bread to the hitthespotsogood yaka meini had found my year round replacement for crawfish bread at katie's see review and now i feared that i would have to wait till next year's jazz fest to get my hands on some yaka mein again since ms linda green aka the yakamein lady doesn't have a restaurant she serves out of though i hear rumors of a food truck lo and behold ask and ye shall receivemy buddy wiggle tells me i can get yaka mein at eatwell food mart on broad and canali was a baby bit skeptical of the location so he said order togo they kind of giggled at me when i said i just wanted a large order of yakamein and said it'd be 10 minutes walking up it looks like a gas station convenience store with tables and then a place to order in the back i hope i didn't look like too much of a newb but when i was being rung up the little lady i assumed is the owner said something in another language to the teller and put a few more bucks on my yaka mein orderhopefully that wasn't 'cause i was a newb but i did get a complimentary bottle of water with my soup this other lady at the register next to me was in the process of trying to win the powerball while the teller read out her numbers jokingly i'll have to remember i can win the powerball while curing my ailments next time around i got home put some ponzu in my yaka mein and devoured the entirety of it it was just as i had remembered though from the eatwell peeps now i look 6 months pregnant with a food baby but it was delicious will definitely be returning to get my winning numbers and more yakayakamein a soup commonly found in creole and chinese restaurants is usually composed of stewed beef in beefbased broth served on top of spaghetti noodles and garnished with a hardboiled egg and chopped green onions cajun seasoning chili powder or old bay seasoning is often added to the broth,positive
5oZAv6_X_1jCoHZ1ozc_QA,i was leery coming here reading the negative reviews but i so glad i did because it was very good the service was excellent the pho was large and flavorful i am half vietnamese and it reminded me of my mom cooking  will definitely come again,positive
zWfzgYe2nT9mHYm_vl1Ukw,when pho meets cajun country it's expected that i need to try this effect i found myself craving pho after a couple of hours walking around city park and playing pokemon go the locals say that this was the place to be but with it being a tuesday afternoon hardly anyone is out playingthankful for yelp as always for locating mopho for me on the app it was about a  12 mile walk from city park which was nice and convenient for me mopho is centrally located so you don't need to venture out side of new orleans to enjoy such infusion yes mopho incorporates an eclectic mix of spices and pairings of food items that it's not hard to say that they were experimenting i arrived here on a tuesday afternoon on a casual november 2019 around 230pm it was a small restaurant in a small commercial cluster of restaurants that's anchored by burger king next door the lunch crowd had largely gone so it was nice to find a table so readily available i probably took at most 1 hour here and i was off to my hotel thereafter the menu was limited but it sure packed a punch i would say that the prices here can be spend but however you're getting pho fusion and other interesting dishes that would make your taste buds come to life with that said i ordered the crispy pork spring rolls for the appetizer and the mopho as the main entrée let's just say that it was a delight coming herewhile the pho itself was delicious and a definite interest in the flavoring i must say that the pork spring rolls were awesome as well i could taste indian curry in it and it was a welcome change from the usual in most vietnamese restaurants i've visited over the years one order of the spring rolls was just one roll so i ordered two for a full effect the pho was earthy and a welcome oasis full of flavor that would welcome any weary traveler wished i had ordered extra noodles with this dish but it is what it is the broth itself had extra flavors that came with the cajun influence and it was worth the expense to come here even though i had other things to do in the area anyway having cajun influenced pho is a bonus for sure for the most part though the ambiance here was nice and casual it was quiet enough till the end of my meal here when the table next to me started to sing happy birthday thought that was cool though the service itself was pretty good and friendly if you're in the new orleans area and want to partake in the cajun inspired pho consider coming to mopho near city park in new orleans i would recommend coming here if you are a diehard pho fanthe overall experience here at mopho new orleans was good and well needed especially after an evening flight to new orleans the night before mopho is located at 514 city park avenue about  12 mile from city park they accept major credit cards which is always a good thing as well as cash since they are in a cozy culdesac parking can be limited here but the parking options are quite generous and optimum for anyone's needs new orleans public transit stops in front of the restaurant on city park avenue so you can get here any time they are open to get your pho fix anytime  as well as other dishes they offer however if public transport isn't an option for you there are uber and lyft at your disposal they can get you here with no problem at all for the most part though my experience here at mopho was good although average at the same time you could tell that the weather was changing even in new orleans it was nice to enjoy a bowl of cajun pho during this time the restaurant itself was arranged nicely and quite nice and homey if you are in the new orleans area and craving pho or anything on their menu best bet is to get here as soon as you can you're missing out if you do45 stars for the overall experience 40 stars for the service 45 stars for the food and the ambiance 30 stars for the prices 40 stars for the servicesupport localb,positive
NCzKKh6npVeq-AvlJnGh3w,i'm going to be honest i probably would have made this a 4 star review except my entree was phenomenal  we stopped in on a saturday evening and were greeted by a lovely server  we ordered the chicken wings and some shrimp spring rolls to start and then between us got an order of rare beef pho some chicken steamed buns and i got a small order of duck  the chicken wings were tasty and the meat was tender though it still can't touch the wings of mopho  the spring rolls were pretty basic i was looking for more fresh herbs and a bit more spice in the peanut sauce the pho broth was rich and deep with the traditional chinese 5 spice and lots of herbaceous notes and the chicken was tender and juicy served with briny and spicy kimchi  both very good  but then i tasted the duck holy hell  for a small portion it looked like half of the animal  the meat was cooked perfectly and very moist the fat was rendered and the skin was slightly crispy and not rubbery at all  the seasoning of the duck was so good i didn't even touch the au jus and just dipped my rice cakes in the duck drippings i left with enough leftovers for another substantial dinner and i have to say it was almost as good on day 2  we left stuffed groaning and happy best duck i've had in a long while,positive
vwX8kUqJwRzbr7JakrwIFA,i had the pleasure of finding this place and ordering take out not knowing that they don't deliver sooo as i opened the door and stepped inside to pick up my food i noticed the beautiful setting very chill  intimate the staff was awesome  very helpful with any of my questions the food was well packaged since it wasn't for dining in and every dish was delicious i will be definitely be back to dine in with my yeoja chingu  alsobyob,positive
nnZIsmpIQnuQY5S-MoGyvg,vegetarian deli meat is there anywhere else in idaho that serves this there may only be one option but it's not half bad and they're decent slices their baguette is nice and crusty but soft in the center so it's not too dense or chewy i don't think i'd use it just for cheese given those qualities but it makes an awesome sandwich the thai boba tea wasn't my thing too sweet they probably made it right and i just don't like thai tea but i found the milk tea much betteri think we confused the poor lady at the counter asking about the meat content of the spring rolls that were sitting there already made so we dropped it and didn't end up trying any either way the sandwich alone is enough to keep us coming backupdate  they will make up fresh spring rolls for you with only the veg meat andor shrimp so veg and pescetarian rolls are an option they come with a dark peanut sauce one earlier reviewer was unhappy with the cajun shrimp sandwich's shrimp content we tried one recently and it was pretty packed with shrimp improvement or inconsistency i'm not sure,positive
3LDXQCWORDgoZ61TfIt1Yg,the food is fantastic the interior is great it's slightly pricey but what do you expect when they use only the best ingredients from places like goose the market the nighthawk is my go to sandwich along with the pork cracklings i'm hoping they do pho soon,positive

XgXkTeOtLpX1QSvh9Qql1A,the service is fast the staff is so friendly if i lived closer i'd eat here daily the food is phonomenal i'm not a big shrimp person i never liked the texture but i will eat the shrimp spring rolls here they are so fresh i love that the peanut sauce is silky smooth i even tried the sugarcane shrimp which is an appetizer that consists of ground shrimp and chicken wrapped around a sugarcane stick yumthe beef pho with rare eyeround steak is my favorite the broth is perfectly seasoned the eyeround is rare so often i go to restaurants and by the time it comes out the meat is brown i'm talking overcooked and hard to chew so i really appreciate when i ask for rare and it comes out that way you can even order extra eyeround i suggest itthere's a ton of great looking items on the menu that i have to try they offer a good selection of vegetarian items i just have a hard time trying something new when i love the pho so much,positive

Iyopb5uFIBT_HOgp8ipSfw,this place is fancy for what you expect for a vietnamese restaurant my cousin took me here because she likes the banh xeo vietnamese omelette which is filled with shrimp bean sprouts and other items apparently that day they wanted to be cost effective so they loaded our banh xeo with very little shrimp but a lot of bean sprouts so we were fooled into thinking how large and packed it looked but was sadly disappointed when we opened it up good thing i also ordered a rice dish with bbq pork shredded pork egg patty and egg or otherwise i'd leave and still be hungry all in all even with less fillings of the banh xeo the food was good i wouldn't chose this place as my goto vietnamese restaurant but if i were in the mood for some banh xeo i'd consider coming again maybe i'll get lucky next time,positive
Bs0JwJEUdfhL-FtLjuu3vA,my dinner was absolutely delicious will definitely recommend  go back it was my first time there  i wasn't sure what u wanted but the cashier suggestion was right on point i had the stir fried noodles vegetables broccoli bok choi carrots baby cornyummy,positive
Rx5lfHMWkezmQjCfr2ziAw,price is great i had the beef pho and my boyfriend had the bah mi we both agreed that the pho was better it's not the greatest pho but this place is so close to home and it can satisfy my craving in a pinch,positive
YKOp8yCwOXVha_RP-vvGag,probably 35 stars half the food was good half the food was okay at bestbang bang shrimp was pretty tasty for sure  flavorfulcajun crack fries  okay at best just a little salty not too flavorfulshrimp and pork spring rolls  tasted okay but they're pretty hard to mess up not wrapped particularly well if that matters to you not to mewith that being said everyone was very nice but also on a saturday evening around 630pm took 2030 minutes for everyone to get their foodfrom what i recall from the original location i had a lovely experience so i'll be back,positive
ueAkLzWFFTzQkq3jzyBlnA,only been in philly for a week and have been here twice the prices are good restaurant is very clean and the staff are quick all in all a great overall experience i hate when people make pho complicated and this place keeps it simple and tasty,positive
QGYzYUMsQe6k7__LD91E5w,this place rocks while its sandwiches are a bit pricier than those of cafe 900 it has a bit broader selection of vietnamese food also its flavor can't be beat everything is made to order right in front of you it's a quiet little takeout place with three barstools for customers to sit at and eat it should be noted that their pho is a bit different than that in the other nearby vietnamese places rather than serving the traditional pho loh they serve a spicier but less vegetable rich pho jin the noodles in their bun vermicelli are also a bit different than the standard fare if you need a place to get some decent vietnamese food at a good price look no further,positive
yXX7xmclZkuBif-7QoyCuw,umami craving try pho edenumami is the fifth taste sense that flavor that isn't sweet bitter salty or sour it's something else i often crave umami a piece of fresh mozzarella with fresh basil is very umami for example and i think a lot of folks do they just don't have a name for it umami is a satisfying richness found in meats cheeses and certain kinds of mushrooms pho eden restaurant offers a variety of dishes that offer fulfillment for your umami cravingif you live in camden county or nearby parts of burlington county you needn't cross the bridge to find great vietnamese food if you aren't sure what umami tastes like your next meal out should be at pho eden in cherry hill i eat at pho eden at least twice a month sometimes more and never tire of itit is a shame that i have been there probably 100 times now and cannot tell you about 95 of the menu here's the problem once you find something you like you will start craving it and ordering it every time you goi almost always order the vegetarian summer rolls 102 to start offthey are just beautifulfresh and fragrant with a delightful peanut sauce for dipping the fried spring rolls are also fab it's fun to wrap them in lettuce before dunking in the sweet and spicy sauce pho is a rice noodle soup it comes in a huge bowl and is a meal in itself you can get it plain or with several different kinds of meat including eye round chicken brisket seafood or pork some friends of mine swear by the 304 pho tai rice noodle soup with eye round steak it comes steaming hot with the pink steak floating on top the steak cooks in the broth and turns brown before your eyes i have been trying not to eat meat but i can never resist taking at least a spoonful of this sublime broth it is not greasy it just tastes so full and satisfying i think it defines umamifor a while i was getting the pho ga chicken noodle soup which if you like chicken is fabulous you can also get the vegetarian version 302 pho rau cai which features a variety of fresh vegetables and a tasty tofu the soups are all served with a side dish of fresh coriander bean sprouts hot peppers and lime so you can adjust the taste to your preferences many also add hot sauce to the equation for me the sprouts coriander and a few squirts of lime add yet another dimension to the flavor with prices ranging from 400 for a small plain noodle soup to 725 for the large seafood version a meal of pho is a delicious bargainin another review of this restaurant here on yelp i recently read that 652 the hot and sour tofu soup is also fantastic and addictive so i will be trying that next time thanks for the tip brandon for those who like chicken i recommend the chicken lemon grass 206 for vegetarians not in the mood for soup the 700 tofu with curry and lemon grass is one of the best tofu dishes i have ever tried anywhere though if you don't like spicy food let them know to make it mild even then it is sometimes a little too hot for me but i am kind of wimpy when it comes to spicy foodif you order an entree be sure to ask for a side of brotha small cup is free with the entree though the staff don't bring it unless you ask another great bonus unsweetened hot and iced teas are free with your mealthe only dishes i have tried that i didn't care for are those with meat balls i think they are just an acquired taste and we westerners have a certain idea in mind when we hear meatball and this just isn't it the vietnamese version might seem rubbery to those accustomed to the italianamerican varietya bun big bowl of rice noodles is a good dish for newbies both meat and vegetarian varieties are available i like the 200 bun cha gioit has spring rolls in it it may not be calorieconscious but few comfort foods are as satisfying and at 575 for a large bowl it's another great choice for those watching their budgetto top off your meal try a fried bananathough i am usually so satisfied i don't need anything except coffee the hot espresso with condensed milk is a coffee and a dessert in onesmooth sweet and strong there are also a variety of fruit smoothies availablethe prices at pho eden are so reasonable the food so irresistible why not try this taste sensation tonight and discover your new cravingthis link has information on umami and links to more articles httpwwwfindingdulcineacomnewsentertainmentumamififthflavorisnumberonepriorityhtml,positive
A9bqf3aoiQXX9WBswewivg,i love this place the food the owner and the  casual and friendly atmosphere their menu combines many of my favorite things  rotisserie chicken kimchi the most delicious mac n cheese and pickled veggies i always try out a different hot sauce  their house sauce is in my top 3 oh and in their chicken bahn mi there's a hidden surprise of fried chicken skin and it will amaze your tastebuds  and on top of all this i really appreciate that the menu on the wall is artfully hand painted things like this allow their quality to shine,positive
MqhQlbkYd9dShIEcPbmS_g,best pho in the philly area place is a little tight but the food is really worth it the only reason for giving it four stars is that the place is really small and i was sitting next to a whole family of people like right next to them,positive
VGN37glLit5oxbHIZ837Ag,you know those nights where you have plenty in the fridge but just don't want to put anything together tonight was that night silver chopsticks to the rescue we rarely eat out but when we do it's often asian since we don't make it at home often we ordered szechuan chicken pad thai shrimp the house special fried rice and two egg rolls from the chinese menu i'd say by the silence at the table everything was delicious i'm fairly picky on the heat of my szechuan i like my food to bite me back this was great  nice heat throughout we thought the pad thai could use more heat  add that to the request next time we order  i would have preferred brown rice as an option but the white rice was perfectly cooked and it didn't have that bleach taste many white rices have you know what i mean the staff here is so gracious and they're really looking forward to opening their doors for dinein until then place your orders to go now note we scarfed this down before even considering taking a pic ,positive
YPTYOQO8Lg9BtHsRwYBY7g,excellent vietnamese restaurant  the best i have had yet since moving to st louis  have only been here for lunch but would like to come for dinner and try some of the entries  nice atmosphere and the pho is excellent  portion size is not big but good enough for lunch,positive

65_MIvrauhGs_jssN4-uUQ,we live in south nashville so i was really excited to read about a new asian fusion place on  nolensville and i was impressed good food great pricesi went to sriracha for dinner on a saturday night with my fiance's brother we took him food to go because he had to work late he was craving pho and i was craving sushi we both got what we wanted at sriracha i had two rolls for about 56 a piece one philly one yellowtail and he had a bowl of pho for cheap too the bbq pork rice dish we took home for my fiance was 6 such an affordable meal and everyone liked what they ordered the restaurant is simple and casual the service was good and they had tvs  so we could watch the college football during dinner all in all it was a great meal and i'm sure my fiance and i will go back,positive
HWLgmRSRDdUwXFkUxf4N-w,i went there last night and it was my first time going i had always passed it by but never really gave it a thought i'm glad it was suggested because the food was deliciousso you have to take this review from someone who hasn't had vietnamese food before i just like what i like and that's that  we walked in after a bunch of people and thought it would be crowded but the opposite was true it was fairly quiet for a friday night at seven that may have more to do with the ambiance than anything else though the server gave us menus and left us for a few minutes by the time he can back we already knew what we wanted to eat and drink that had nothing to do with the server though we just were starving and picked something quicklyi ordered fresh spring rolls which came quickly and they were so good it came with a sweet chili sauce with peanuts that was okay but i didn't eat ironically i had peanut butter themed ice cream from cold stone two doors down because of it but that's another review then i had the chicken breast noodles i ate about half because i was so full but wanted to keep going because it was that good i enjoyed the every bit of the food and the restaurant itself,positive
QVqLR6SJZP9DyeYVR9esUg,great pho and bahn mi sandwiches not on the menu and listed as only for take out for 5 the prices are slightly high for what you get and they could include a bit more noodles but it is definitely a good place to check outi wish they had some combo with pho  2 or 3 bahn mi at a discount price so everyone can split the pho and have their own bahn mi i'd definitely go there more often if they had that optionbesides that you can't go wrong by checking this place out if you enjoy pho and don't mind mediumish prices,positive
nnZIsmpIQnuQY5S-MoGyvg,i have frequented baguette deli vietnamese sandwiches so many times that it deserves a reviewthe food  i'm a creature of habit  i have visited this vietnamese restaurant at least 10 times and have only tried 2 things on the menu  that is how yummy these two dishes are  first the spring rollsfresh  shrimp and vegetables with a peanut sauce  so tasty and under 4 for three  surprisingly filling what a healthy option for lunch  then there is the holy grail of what is all and good in this worldpho pronounced fuh  it is phoking fantastic  a large bowl of long simmering broth including the bones and flank infused with fragrant spices that delicately balance out the broth think star anise cinnamon cloves  cardamom arrives with thin slices of raw beef that have been added to the broth at the last minute before serving  the noodles are long white rice noodles  its accompaniment of thai basil bean sprouts jalapenos green onions and cilantro along with a hoisin sauce sriracha and lime allows you to customize your experience  the bahn mi's are extremely popular and i may have to venture outside my box and try them nextambiance  located next to a fred meyer in a strip mall this place maybe seats 1520  on most days unless the weather is amicable the deli is so busy that often people ordering can barely fit in the line  the door to the restaurant is then held open a lot patrons coming and going can affect the temperature of the small establishment  there is nothing remarkable about the space and my suggestion is to take your meal to goservice  quick and friendlyprice  less than 10 with a drink for most items on the menuhands down the quickest freshest and most tasty option for a lunch,positive
lnK5fYvIlvRoA4WBan_VBQ,i have eaten there twice last time was a call in order which i still had to wait for awhile to get when i got there  the pho is great it comes with lots of side bags to add to your pho to specialize it he way you want,positive

gsyyVQmvT9A2nAgUi7VUag,we visited on a dreary cold rainy day my wife ordered the pho and i ordered hebrew hammer ramen pictured both had delicious rich broth with a little kick the chicken thighs in the hebrew hammer were tender also ordered a nonramen aka an appetizer of tamarind fried chicken  boneless it was delicious and had a nice pankolike coating friendly and quick service highly recommended,positive
AzylMkpWl-OLWQLMKVRoVg,this little gem opened up in the old falcon location in the heart of downtown but i had yet to visit so i made a point to pop in on this brisk winter's eve the restaurant is decorated modestly with plenty of seating for such a small establishment the lay out is still very much as it was with the previous folks but modernized just a biti was very surprised to find all of their drinks on the 2 for 1 happy hour specials even bottled drinks i ordered up a sake which came in an individual bottle warmed while my friend enjoyed the plum wine the menu offered up a nice selection of beers with options spanning asia the wine selection was also nice but most options from the uswith  12 off appetizers we would be crazy not to try at least a couple we ordered the summer rolls with tofu normally 550 and the sizzling saigon crepe normally 575 both were fantastic the summer rolls came with a very light peanut sauce that provided a delicate flavor without over powering the rolls the crepe was something i had never had before it was filled with shrimp and chicken served with herbs cucumber and carrots and lettuce to wrap around it very tastywhen we first arrived our service was great with the server being very attentive but as our time there progressed the service got a little spotty i couldn't tell if a different server had taken over and we were just forgotten about or if our server had just gotten overwhelmed with tables we still very much enjoyed the food drinks and atmosphere we would definitely return and try some of the other tasty offerings on the menu,positive
ooUI-JC2tu0J-vavmOHZYQ,tried going to kien giang last night and realized it was closed for the season bummer but i found this gem and couldn't be happier first it's cash only so make sure you come prepared second it's smaller so you might need to wait a bit third the food and prices as amazing got the spring and egg rolls for a starter fresh and delicious then went with the beef pho for main dish the hubby got the tofu pho and thoroughly enjoyed it can't wait to go back,positive
wVLJwTaeTlTFr4il0pVJ5g,their sushi is amazing the fried yum yum roll  the fried vegas rolls are my favorite so freaking good best sushi around we always get takeout  they're super fast  accurate,positive
5oZAv6_X_1jCoHZ1ozc_QA,was concerned with all the negative reviews but also saw some food ones so the wife and i decided to give it a go really glad we did food was excellent and the service was top notch wife had the chicken rice bowl and loved it really liked the egg rolls so fresh i had the flank soup bowl and it was excellent we will for sure be back often,positive
hm7YQpJlaeMKh2QGtWVhtg,i literally stopped here with my friend angie on a whim because i was craving pho other than waiting for awhile while there weren't many of other customers it was worth the waitthe pho was spectacular the broth was flavorful and everything was fresh definitely satisfied my pho craving will definitely stop here again if i'm in the area,positive
oskXqC-K0AFLtgbTA4D3gQ,we love getting dinner from sab  we have searched for thai food this good and it is absolutely worth the visit  they are covid respectful with outdoor seating including a great little outdoor bar with televisions included  the owner is extremely friendly even serving the bar guests  we recommend this restaurant to everyone we know our great dane puppy george loves it too,positive
pdh91rffpM9QptHSXjJFVQ,viet kitchen took over the spot where pho nhu trang was which i loved however vk fills the slot admirably they totally redesigned the interior to look more modern and fresh my first visit was a five star experience bun bo nuong was great i get this dish often at viet restaurants and it's in my top 2 of all the places i've been the beef is higher quality than most the herbs and veggies were fresh the fish sauce provided some tang easy on the wallet too 895also tried a couple of their drinks since they havea bogo deal for their grand opening i think desserts are also bogo at this time i got both of my drinks viet tea and mango tea with cheese foam both were fine but i preferred the mango tea which had bits of fresh mango i would've liked more tea and less cheese foam and the nice waitress said she could accommodate me next timeservice was very attentive and friendly nice touch adding peanut mms with my bill  as i mentioned the atmosphere is nice and i appreciated the viet music and viet tv program playing in the background i'll be back again this week to try other items and will add some more photos they do have plenty of veganveg items and some unique items sure to please everyone yelp them out,positive

Pot1NXi4WnIoQj5bmg0oww,this place is small friendly staff and great food which is what we really came for  they let you pay with a handheld pos system which is pretty good technology for such a small place prices are kind of pricey compared to its indianapolia counterparts but i'm happy to pay a couple bucks more to stay in town a definite addition to my small town eats and very thankful they have chosen to be in brownsburg,positive
v6tFMx_fKBcfiBagKb_EIg,my first experiences with daleng was trying them during an open house event they were some of the best tofu and chicken banh mi i had had especially the tofu ever since i personally chose to cater from them during the events i hosted later last year yesterday i went in person and got the chicken banh mi and veggi eggplant curry the chicken banh mi was delicious should i say consummate even i previously only consumed it after having it sit cold for a few hours  even then it tastes greati really liked the eggplant curry often times the peanut flavoring can be a tad overwhelming but in this curry it was perfect the service is also amazing the cashier was quite affable and attentivebecause of my continuously positive experiences i will come here again and again,positive
6kAXOzE7fqaBZINQV_-_mg,is it poor form to update my update but i must i've finally broken out of my 3 bun rut  with a friend the other day we ordered the shrimp wonton soup which was so perfect i think i began levitating and he got the raw beef which is sliced thin and marinated in lime juice and basil at first a tad wary we polished that plate off with our eyes wide oh my gracious i'm heading over again in a minute how could a small local place make such friggin' amazing food so reliably i don't know but this is my favorite place hands down food heaven for so cheap amazing,positive

nP4oASaVyGV-FWkxE-zmEw,i almost gave this place 4 stars but i don't want to be the one to break their 5star streak i had the steak and brisket pho the broth was definitely one of the better if not the best in boise it does have an oily feel which leads me to believe it was slow cooked with fatty meats for hours as someone else said there is a faint sweetness to it almost a slight taste of star anise i doctored it up as i always do with hoisun and sriracha my only criticism is it was a little noodle heavy and a little light on the meat the steak and brisket was so good that i kept searching fruitlessly through my mass of noodles for more but came up empty then after minutes of searching i saw that one slice of brisket was stuck to the side of the bowl hidden by the broth that last precious bite of meat was extra heavenly just wanted more for 12 you know also you do get 15 off right know but still more meat pleasethe waitress was very sweet i used to go here when it was pho 76 and i hope the owner of that place and his daughters are doing well i do think about them this will be my goto pho place if i'm over in that end of town don't be alarmed by floating things in your water it's just bits of lemon or lime they place in the pitchers a nice touch for sure will come back and look forward to trying more menu items,positive
o7cD_sDA-Evj3Oh0zeH9nQ,being right around the corner from my office i visit this spot for takeout every now and again around lunchtime the food keeps me coming back the language barrier makes things interestingi have ordered several different pho combos with my favorite being the 9 with rare beef and brisket i also get the fresh spring rolls the broth is amazing and even in a togo order is piping hot when i get it back to the office a large is easily two days worth of lunches they provide plenty of fresh lime thai basil cilantro and bean sprouts along with a large portion of noodles and meat chili paste and plum sauce are in little containers and included as well the spring rolls are different than i've ever had with both shrimp and thinly sliced pork along with lettuce rice noodles and the chewy rice paper wrapper the pork inside is not my favorite just because it is a bit dry and the texture overwhelms the other delicious things inside they include peanut sauce which is always delicious but it would be wonderful to add some fresh chopped peanut for an added crunch as well be sure to check your order when doing togo there is a language gap and things get mistaken from time to time or better yet order by the item number in the menu and there will be no issue you don't leave a name number or anything after calling in an order you just have to trust that they got it and it will be waiting after 1015 minutes which for me it always has been but was definitely offputting the first few times i ordered they have reopened the dining tables so you can eat there again but it's connected to the gas station next door so i don't know that i ever will lastly prices are so incredibly reasonable the food is good cheap and quick what more can you ask of a takeout spot,positive
eoqpPPlegPddFATQadDsoA,i love green mint my husband and i eat here often the food is always fresh and delicious the teriyaki tofu is fabulous husband likes the pho,positive
Usj0t1Ts3zoTBnjhi-WA3A,since there is no difference between the two locations i can tell besides a full bar my thoughts on the downtown location are the same for the sam hughes location  everything is very tasty and the non pho options are great  maybe not a great happy hour location but awesome for a casual midweek dinner,positive
jwhehZsAlBa6_noZmprzpQ,excellent pho crab rangoon is ok the lemon grass pork is the best service is good just confusing when you enter perhaps a more informative host or signs inside,positive

pDUcsN79bDwhOMBaD_tm-g,oh my ga this place serves some of the best pho i've had in a very long time pho ga is a nice change from heavier and richer beef pho this is a no frills place with no menu cause they only serve one thing luckily that keeps decisions pretty easy small or large plain or chicken the broth is so flavorful while still being light and clear the chicken they use is well cooked which the right amount of chewiness and made even more delicious with the salt and pepper dipping sauce you'll eat a bowl and feel instantly rejuvenated it's in kensington so the area can be rough and the train running overhead can be loud but that's all worth it for a delicious bowl of these noodles the space is small but they turnover quick,positive
2tucChH-AHwYodE100lNfQ,when we pulled up to the lessthanideal strip center pho real is stationed in we had our doubts the outside could use some love but luckily we'd seen this stellar yelp reviews and great photos of the clean interior and continued on thank goodness we didthe server was incredibly kind friendly and efficient and the food was piping hot and completely scrumptious i'd been craving wantons for some time so we started off with the beef and shrimp wantons appetizer they came in a cute bamboo steamer basket as well as with a side of jalepenos and sprouts they were sooooooo warm and savory definitely coming back for themwe also ordered the 'fullcooked beef' pho and pad thai with chicken the pho was yummy as was the beef i really enjoyed the spices they used and couldn't finish it it was that big my husband said his pad thai was the secondbest he's had in his life and we go to a lot of thai places these are high remarks as i also tried the pad thai and loved it they did the sauce right so many places don't have much taste in the sauce if you don't order it spicy yet this one completely did our server was super sweet and ran the place well there were other families in the restaurant including several young children the server was gracious to a mom trying to clean up the floor after her child's mess and took care of it for them definitely very kidfriendly,positive
L6nIOUwcTGgQKExGHmvTzQ,hands down the best place for pho in sb but beware the owner's asian like the old school grandma asian that has no qualms yelling at the customers but sometimes she's not yelling she's just talking to the customers but it sounds like yelling because we asians don't have volume control why is she so angry  oh no she's just thanking them for coming it gets packed easily  small restaurant and the ventilation isn't that great so it gets hot quickly too the servers  they try their best and at times that's all you can ask for fairly cheap considering this is santa barbara i haven't tried anything else besides their pho i get the large one with everything but tripe i don't even know what tripe is i just know it looks weird and feels weird and their spring rolls but i don't really anything else but their pho and spring rolls  especially on those blistering cold days in santa barbara where the entire female population don on yoga pants wit ugg boots,positive

M9EMOYyem3oWU1VLl2NiKg,so i would not recommend this place the second star came because the portion was huge other than that the broth was extremely bland the noodles were so stuck together i could barely get them with the chop sticks the spring roll was okay nothing special the waitress never came check on me after she took my order and brought my drink i went walk to the counter to pay cause they didn't even bring me a bill the left overs stayed there they just were not good enough to take,negative
n_7EQxn0ciucIOJfpWVaTQ,totally over rated the emperor has no clothes i walked in to a crowded disorganized mess this place would have been ok in college however my taste has improved after seating ourselves i read the menu and ordered the pho with beef the waitress told me that the beef is served raw i stood up to see the open kitchen i quickly asked the kind waitress to have my beef cooked my spouse ordered the seafood soup bland small shrimps small pieces of squid not too appetizing when my meal arrived it smelled great but the pho was over spiced  at least it was hot the portions are large and the prices are very reasonable i think that is what lures the regulars but if your looking for something special go elsewhere this place would be great in ybor city but its in an out of the way strip mall on waters ave west of dale mabry also it closes at 5pm every day yes i said 5pm,negative
Y4Ur3avr_tGMyQaDHMUdhw,i did not see any shrimp and scallop in my seafood curry but it took me 1500 really bad experience i will never come back again,negative
nxdtFZh00Bdzf_OUNYdhYg,we went for a quick lunch today when you go to a restaurant and they say sit wherever you want you should be aware they might not have a good service yeap this is one of the places they didn't even give us a menu or serve us until five minutes later we ordered pho and spring rolls  all classic dishes the spring roll was ok standard but the pho was below average first the serving is small i guess you really get what you are paying for a large for about 7 will only have five pieces of meat the broth is not clear and it doesn't taste as authentic as other places we had around nashville,negative
x4K6aMaOYvGhC5jhFJP2Ag,the decor and service is nice but its not enough to compensate for the food tried the pho and bun bo hue both were extremely lacking in flavourbody but overly salty really disappointed,negative
lnK5fYvIlvRoA4WBan_VBQ,do not even bother have not been here for a while  i am pulling out of the parking lot with out even having what i ordered the ladies bathroom was filthy so i asked for my money back before my order arrived my first sign should have been that there were no cars out front and it was 1255pm when i pulled up,negative
SPEXSaryxJmVpy8QoRz7Tg,so i went to vietnam cafe with a friend tonight for university city dining days  the place is beautiful but the food leaves something to be desired  i started with the shrimp and pork spring rolls which were heavily breaded and fried even though the description on the menu made it a point to say they were not fried they still tasted good  my main course was the vermicelli with chicken  the chicken is definitely overcooked  it was dry and very tough  the vermicelli was also dry and there was no type of sauce the entree was very bland and flavorless i ended up using the sauce that came with the spring rolls just to give it a little flavor  for dessert i had the corn pudding which was okay  i doubt i will be going back,negative
pG5hLBK49Oz2TLX2qY6UQw,the server is very rude  my mom dined with us  she asked what was the white sauce as detailed in the description for shrimp and vegetables  he was rude in his reply it's white sauce  she asked for sweet and sour sauce and the guy just stood there silent  we didn't get our water refilled once during our dining experience   the portion sizes of entrees are very small   he tosses the check on the table without having cleared off any of the dirty dishes  in fact while we were still eating   horrible place i won't be back,negative
14ZGwnDyydXdSBsLXpSUrA,had lunch at vientiane cafe  unfortunately it wasn't any better than i'd remembered itpast experience with vientiane cafe indicates that one shouldn't order meat here all the meat i've seen here has been overcooked i ordered an eggplant veggie dish which was poorly executed the texture of the eggplant was not great  it wasn't cooked well the dish was edible but not very tasty disappointing,negative

NtfDrs753JK4dLFmjPJl7w,i came in to eat with my boyfriend on our break for work there was only one other table when we arrived and through the entirety of our meal but it took over 30mins for us to get our food we only ordered one item a lobster banh mi which should have been prepared fairly quickly and not take as long as 30mins the other table already had their food when we arrived too the bartender had to check on us and our food since the server did not check up on us at all after we put in our order our entire break was wasted here waiting for one sandwich we will not be coming back,negative
qtlDqYE5Dnn-lztBw4qXrg,this place was just okay the fresh spring rolls were good the grilled pork banh mi was pretty good  although they served it with parsley not cilantro and only after i insisted it wasn't cilantro did they realize that their produce distributor messed up which i find really disturbing i'm a white girl but i could tell by looking at it that it was parsley and not cilantro come on anyway it seemed really americanized which is not what i'm looking for in a vietnamese restaurant i don't know who is to blame for the blandification of asian food in america but please stop give us some flavor anyway i don't really recommend this place unless maybe you're new to vietnamese and afraid of flavor,negative
n_7EQxn0ciucIOJfpWVaTQ,i usually like this place but horrible experience today served me ice cold pho and when i asked for it to be hot i was told this is the way its supposed to be served  come oni know better  the guy working the register i think his name is sean was the one to tell me this  i will never go here again and left it fully un eaten but paid for it   i  am very unhappy and will share my experience with everyone i know,negative
LBqAH3KQEuLX5XIWLjBGnQ,after craving a bowl of pho i decided to give pho 9 a try i ordered the summer rolls with shrimp as well as the pho tai chin the ingredients inside the rolls were very fresh but overall the dish was very bland my pho was good but definitely could have been better the meat was cooked well and was very tasty however the broth lacked any flavoring and the soup did not come accompanied with sriracha or other sauces to add overall my experience was okay  but i will probably try another restaurant next time,negative
jIfRcC9Vd_bz66nVsoEMzA,supporting small businesses during time of economic crisis was what brought us to pho orchid for take out today but it will be the last time i support them bo ne had about 10 small pieces of meat and they forgot the rice and everything was cold and we were there within 10 min of ordering the foodi'm done waste of money and time,negative
KzGXMHnlrknUhEjNyD8yZQ,it's not clean and dirty atmosphere the food is bluh they probably have different cook anymore d base soup taste fishy and smell dirty i wouldn't go back there no more,negative
Rd8Gb82UQcPPWC_yY5ybDg,why have a please wait to be seated sign and have customers standing there looking stupid before telling them to seat themselves order the grilled chicken dish and had the chicken wings as appetizers next time i'll go with the phoa the grilled chicken had good seasoning but the fried egg roll contained some sort of mystery meat that was kinda funky the chicken wings were greasy as hell and i had to squeeze them in a napkin first before even attempting to consume them i may give them another shot but go for one of their phoa dishes,negative
8m3-Xrqr2dkF-lLz5H1ZrA,i cannot speak for the pho as i only ordered lomein i thought they made the wrong order because it looks like black pepper beef no worries they can get it right on the next one surprise to take a first bite of charred fleckthat unmistakable crumch the disintegration to dirt the works i immediately reached for my mango drink to wash the pot mouth and reeled from sugar shockpow i'm sunken like an iron anchor,negative
v5jxpGnKbx3vVxs28dgokQ,i had a craving for asian food and this spot seemed to be the only spot available in the near vicinity  ordered a few basic things such as eggrolls springrolls and filet mignon entree  the food looked promising in its packaging  i wanted to have a clean slate when eating asian food in a not so asian area but of course it does not live up to standards  i have had good and great asian food  it's all over socal so this fell quite far from expectations  the rolls were meh and that's a pretty basic dish  the filet mignon dish is actually a pretty basic vietnamese dish but they turned it into an asian beef stir fry i would give it a 1 star but the people were so nice and the place so inviting  i will steer clear of asian food in this area  sorry sb,negative
ju4YP8SLdR_BmWr_-Xh83Q,when they first opened we enjoyed their food  went quite regularly for basic pho egg rolls and my husband for their sandwiches  i gave them a 4 star for service attitude food quality and preparation  then for several months we didn't go  when we did return i had a horrible experience  the pho broth had a thick layer of fat and not beefy tasting at all  it tasted like some artificial stock mix that was cooked with a lot of fat meat or  the lack of lean meat  i was hungry and ate but couldn't drink the broth  even with that afterward i had to heave up the fat that coated my throat and mouth  it wasn't pretty  very disappointed with the downgrade of stock  i wish them the best but can't go back now ,negative
_1wGbJlj9gRIcbGikrhUmA,the food was okay but the service wasn't great the fried rice was pretty good overall i've def had betterwouldn't recommend they have a rating promo where if u rate highly you get a free dessert which makes it hard to believe the reviews,negative
A-J4oCKxiwBV6xV1AGyAyA,i've gone to this place multiple times and they forget to give me my food i think this has happened to me there like four times already i used to still go because it was the closest place i can get pho but then they got rid of all of the mexican waiting staff that stuff was really funny and kept me going back now that they got rid of them i'm not crazy about the place and haven't gone back,negative
_NozEKb4y0jkC08DWU8ywA,we chose golden flower based on yelp reviews and sadly we were let down the restaurant itself is big and clean we arrived a little after 4pm there was only 1 table occupied at the time of our arrival we were greeted seated and handed our menus water came shortly afterfor starters we ordered the spring rolls and imperial rolls both came out within 10 minutes the spring rolls were fresh the rice paper it was wrapped in was still warm imperial rolls was good it was served on a bed of lettuce topped with noodles pickled carrots and daikon i liked that instead of getting 4 rolls we got 5since it was a cold and rainy day in reno we thought it was a good idea to have soup for the kids we ordered a large meatball soup to share my husband and i both had the chicken pho the only difference was that i had rice noodles and my husband had egg noodlethe broth for our soups was kinda bland we had to dress it up a lot with sriracha and hoison but it still didn't helpgolden flower is generous with their soup but skim you on the noodles they have nothing on pho in the bay area the service was decent but i wouldn't come back because we left unsatisfied ,negative

ZAnLKdfQhX0pj3cwo3JSDg,i am not sure if i will ever go back again first of all the service was so so we had waited for 5 minutes before we got up and got one of the waitresses to serve us some water second the food tasted ok but the portion was way to small it might be alright for a skinny girl on a diet but i am notthird the price was way to expensive valencia rice with 4 medium shrimps tax and tip included would cost you 20 dollars personally i would rather go to other fancy places to get much more portion and much more tastes in my plate,negative
iVUn8TARiBRzrgvDXpqONw,one word describes the food and service here  trashi ordered pho and nem noung rolls and my girlfriend ordered the seafood banh canh  pho and banh canh came out first they gave me a pho that i did not order wasn't a big deal but when i mentioned it no one did anything about it  pho broth was bland and smelled like chinese herbal medicine never thought i'd say this but i found a restaurant that serves pho worse than pho 75  the banh broth was also bland will never order from here again don't waste your time or money here go to nam phuong  viet houng or le viet,negative
6kAXOzE7fqaBZINQV_-_mg,i just came back with my wife from this restaurant we came into the restaurant and sat nobody approached us after waiting for about 10 minutes finally they gave us the menu list we then waited for another 10 minutes still nobody came to ask us for order while waiting i saw two white guys with suit coming into the restaurant and they sat right behind us the waitress immediately went to them and asked them what to order i was so shocked i told her we came here first she replied wait let me take order from them first i said no we came here first not them and we have been waiting here for a while she then rudely told me i don't care my blood was streaming really fast i raised my voice and said you have to treat people equally my wife and i decided to leave the restaurant right awayi really can't stand unequal treatment,negative
VSJMIlxwEF19LH0sToLqxQ,i ordered what i thought was pho  i got a chicken broth with veggies broccoli and carrots  when asking the lady working there about the oxtail soup usually served as the broth of pho she replied her restaurant does not serve oxtail soup  so be warned,negative
OPY3LH0XkYrczLk0NcmRig,grabbed some banh mi from this place and was pretty disappointed got a spicy chicken because they didn't have pork which i didn't mind and a lemongrass tofu i love lemongrass tofu banh mis but this one was not good the tofu wasn't actually marinated with lemongrass instead the lemongrass flavor came from their spreadsauce i honestly don't care as long it taste good but unfortunately it didn't their lemongrass sauce was way too salty and it was spread on the crevice where the sides of the buns met so it was salty on one side of the hoagie leaving the other side bland i ended up ripping off lots of the bread parts where there was too much spread because it just too salty and ended up wasting a lot of bread i think it would be better if they toss the tofu with spreadsauce before placing it in the hoagie they seems to over sauce their hoagies because we had the same problem with the spicy chicken one all we tasted was the spicy sauce concentrated on surprise one side on the bright side their milk tea is pretty good but i'm going to pass on the hoagies in the mean time,negative
l4ce2PFU6NWUvJYRZTl6-g,my wife and i was looking forward in eating here last night  after all it is one of our favorite date night restaurants back in nyto our disappointment this place flat out sucks  it was late in the day after the mall had closed and they was barely at half occupancy  so we shouldn't have been forgotten about as long as we did  the timer on my phone was reading 5minutes and 37seconds when someone finally asked if we had been helped  we order our drink and food all in one gofirst to arrive was the hot and sour soup  my cup was warm but my wife complained hers was cold   before i even finished the soup our entrees came out  the beef and broccoli we order was flavored well but the beef was very tough to eat  the sesame chicken  the chicken was cooked perfectly but lacked any flavor  and finally after we finished dinner the egg rolls we had order for a starter came out with apologies that the kitchen was backed up by the other four tables food ordersall during the meal nobody asked if everything was okay or if we needed more refills,negative

cT5BTXa0RdtGw3Vazs843A,i don't even know where to begin on all the bad things i have to say about this restaurant the food is called the service was terrible and the waitress added her own tip on to my credit card receipt i used to use her as a child with my mother and all i can say is that the service has done a complete 180 and so has the food i do not recommend eating here go to panda express it's better,negative

IiSXzsFJaFEMTkiUsPFm_g,this restaurant was my goto vietnamese restaurant unfortunately tonight's experience was extremely frustrating i ordered via door dash and had no issues with the process or delivery itself pho hoang gave the driver the wrong order and wasn't even a complete order i would have tried another entree but it was only a partial order for pho i tried to call the restaurant for 10 mins and consistently heard a buzzy tone as if they took the phone off the hook i drove to pho hoang and explained the situation they gave me the corrected entree and they indicated that another customer called to say she didn't receive her full order which i had they did not offer to discount my order or provide any restitution for the inconvenience poor customer service,negative
dvs-RLII_zdcxfjoqOFJzw,i've heard some people say this is the best pho in the sb area while others claim it's phamous cafe the latter is correcti came here on a friday night with some friends and the restaurant was moderately filled the service when ordering was quick the options on the menu were your typical types of pho there's even a shrimp one some dry vermicelli bowls and some rice plates the prices were alright for sbi ordered the pho with brisket and tripe it was okay just okay but that's all i can say the noodles were kind of sour and way too soft it was weird i noticed our spoons were covered in greasy fat bits afterwards too the soup was alright but there was something missing it didn't taste homey or boney if that makes any sensethe service throughout declined i asked for water a few times and they kept forgetting one of the employees was somewhat rude i couldn't tell if the place was authentically vietnameseoverall i'd head to phamous and only went here for the experience,negative

nxdtFZh00Bdzf_OUNYdhYg,after trying other option in their menu this definitely would be my choice in restaurant to returned to i order grub hub through yelp directly and to be honest i wasn't a fan my pho broth came cold i had to reheat it while they're very cheap with the meat i got about 2 small slices and probably about 2 meatball cut into 4 i ordered egg rolls too but ended up giving it to my coworkers since it was highly disappointing this place is very americanize and not worth it,negative

GPYnUAfT7UgbtzIdlfPrAA,it is rare for yelp to steer me wrong my boyfriend and i were on our way to the zoo and i picked the highest ranking place in the immediate area that served sandwiches for lunch this is merely a convenience store selling 40s and snacks with hot meals and sandwiches being cooked in the back there is one long table for eating at lunchtime it is filled with construction workersthe special was pasta and the ingredients must have come from a can it was anything but special and tasted like spaghettio's from a can the roll that came with wasn't soft and seemed a bit stalei live in a largely vietnemese neighborhood in philadelphia and regularly eat delicious authentic vietnemese hoagies this was anything but authentic the vietnemese sandwich was smothered with mayo and the roll was not toasted the sandwich had a ton of meat but the sandwich itself grossed me out and i gave it to my boyfriend the cook also did not wear gloves which i tried to not think about while we were waiting for our foodother than being quick i don't see the draw to this place,negative

l4ce2PFU6NWUvJYRZTl6-g,incredible flavors fantastic menu boasting all the originals and some great new ideas good service solid bar options and deserts one of the prime spots  up til i took a look at their nutrition facts the amount of sodium in each dish is insane this is so unhealthy the soups alone offer a few day's worth of salt that is worse than any amount of fat a fast food joint does to you i really want to see these big chain restaurants get with the nutrition aware culture the modern world is going for it's gross to pay good cash on food prepared well and using fresh ingredients but loaded up with this much sodium i've been seeing a lot of sodium warnings in various health articles the sodium content has got to be lowered to get me back here,negative

RvIlsB_kQBqCkTjdmIMDUw,so against better judgement but also because i wanted something slightly healthier than the crap i had been eating and drinking while staying at the eldo for our annual guys trip i did a last stop at pho mein for a bite before catching my flight i went with a chicken pho and their veggie spring rolls the spring rolls with oeanit sauce were okthe pho is not my cup of tea first off they have dark meat in it who the heck uses dark meat chicken  it should be all white breast meat i've tried plenty of pho spots i over the years a buddy of mine also tried the banh mi again and said the bread was still not the good one bummer as this used to have the best bahn mi's around,negative
ueAkLzWFFTzQkq3jzyBlnA,i wish i could give this place zero stars too bad that's not an option i've been a loyal customer here for years and consistently go here for pho when i'm in chinatown or taking a lunch break from work this happened to me about three months ago but since i decided to start yelping again i feel strongly to write this and put this out therei usually get the pho when i got it it had a visible piece of hair i usually don't like to make a fuss about wrong orders or my orders at all but come on a visible piece of hair so i call one of the waiters over and he sees it and takes my bowl away less than a minute later i get my food back and guess what the same piece of hair is still there and it just looked like they stirred the other stuff around i really wanted to walk out at that point anyway don't ask me what ended up happening but needless to say i will never be returning to choo choo's again and will be anti choo choos forever go to pho ha in south philly if you want some decent service or pho choo choos is garbage,negative
Q4NmqOOn2ZhzgxtcTJXh3g,ever since this restaurant moved to the larger space the service has been horrible our waitress was pleasant today but the guys who work here are all rude they had only three servers working on a busy sunday and we didn't get our appetizer were told they didn't have time to make smoothies and had to struggle to make eye contact with our server to request forks i won't be giving this restaurant another chance,negative

364nhy8VvBXXEXKXREESyg,we've been to this place about six times so far and i think last night was the last time for uswhen we first went it was novel to have a vietnamese option so close by the food wasn't great but it was at least inoffensive and a reminder of what we used to enjoy fairly often at the end of a long drive to the citythe food quality has gotten progressively worse as has the service last night we had seafood pho pork buns cha gio chicken satay and cafe sua da insipid doesn't accurately describe the broth in the soup which tasted like the runoff from cleaning the floor at a gorton's processing plant the cha gio were old stale and undercooked the pork belly was unidentifiable as pork and tasted absolutely unseasoned the cafe sua da was crammed into the smallest to go cup possible over microscopic crushed ice it tasted like it had been made three days ago and then put up in a jug i can't vouch for the chicken my wife guarded it quite jealously so it must at least have been innocuousservice our impolite waiter was more interested in playing hide and seek i asked for fish sauce to try and add some flavor to the pho and got a sneer and the passing comment that it was on the table that's my graphic attempt to try and represent the doppler effect as he rocketed around an empty restaurant trying to seem occupied note there was no fish sauce on the table40 for this save your skrilla and run up to saigon on rt 309 or break down and plan a philly excursion,negative
688sqo63oc2y535vI2UbhQ,weaki was very unimpressed with my food here  the summer rolls were tiny and understuffed the chicken in my pho was dry and the broth was tasteless  needless to say i had to slam it with sriracha and all the fixings  service was a little slow  and there were only 3 other parties in the place at 630pmyou're way better off going down the street to vietnam or heading down to 11th  washington for viet huong or nam phuong,negative
ZOZ94_vjuogm6PzmuIa1FQ,i'm a huge sushi fan and this place is by far the worst place i had sushi rolls tasted terrible rice were hard and every pieces were so small price paid 22 for 3 small rolls like are you kidding never ordering from here again,negative
5cMfM2_S0DZBLnPcxadl3g,no one should have to wait 45 minutes for takeaway thai food if you are going to be that slow then get a phone so people can call inwait half an hourthen come in to get itthe soup tasted like it was made from cheap tinned stock had a metallic aftertaste  the meat had no flavor at all i mean none i would have thought it was cooked in plain water with no spices blahthe girl working the counter was at least apologetic for the waitthe girly said the chicken sandwich was okwill never go back,negative
JPoLb8jZYc5e7WjI2coVkQ,this place has the most atomically hot and mediocre banh mi the sandwich wasn't necessarily bad there are just much better and cheaper options in nashville also their bubble teas are way too icy,negative
l4ce2PFU6NWUvJYRZTl6-g,worst servicei would have given a zeroordered one main course and never served says cancelled my bill i had to come out without having anything ridiculous,negative
PzhPMkaNYiKDTHoTG0r8rw,ordered the pho dac biet and beef spring rollspho isn't over the top their tendons are a little offputting trust me i love me some tendons in my pho but it wasn't happening for me here i have cats tongue and usually can't eat scolding pho but i do expect it to come out as so unfortunately it came out probably a little too late the service was friendly though location and decor is pretty cozywill i come back only if someone drags me back to try something i didn't order then we can have further debate but out of my own time i don't think so,negative
eoqpPPlegPddFATQadDsoA,no where to sit website doesn't advise we drove 45 min to sample the food my daughter was so excited huge disappointment should update web site,negative
OHqerLBHsIe1laHeMSYoDQ,this place must have a new owner because it is not the same please don't make your decision to go based on old reviews i was very disappointed in the soggy french toast and bland home fries which appeared old i really was expecting the home fries made from potatoes as i saw in photos but was given something entirely different,negative
n_7EQxn0ciucIOJfpWVaTQ,i was really disappointed for many reasons if i could give zero stars i would've i really can't even explain why this place is always so packed or that the reviews are goodfirst of all its not really a clean place walls are barren nothing special about the place at all it just look dingythey were quick to greet but after we ordered and our soup was dropped off server was no where to be foundparking is ok but i can see it gets packedtrash was all over the outside aideof the building very obvious it was from this placenow let me get to the soup horrible the broth was dark it tasted sweet which was not good honestly i'd have to say its the worst soup i've had in tampa bay i usually go to pho huong in riverview which serves amazing fresh soup this place had 1 size soup hardly any noodles and a baby plate of bean sprouts basil etci have tried one of their sandwiches which was recently good can't complain about it pricing was excellent but quality is not so excellent overall i would say look for another vietnamese place for better soup better service and a cleaner environment,negative
6ixTweh-QM88GDrHTjegGA,i started off by calling to make a reservation and was put on hold for over 20 minutes i was still on hold when i walked in and the hostess looked and answered me then i was put on the wait list for 30 minutes until i finally left i've ate at this location a hundred times but this was 100 the worst fail ever i'd give this visit zero stars if i could do better,negative
ZNOc9LErlBDtJF3Y7LQtwA,definitely not worth it overpriced for the quality the food was served really quickly but it didn't taste fresh at all the ban mi tasted awful the bread was good the pho was very salty do not recommend,negative
-Ah-gbZpa-IiQVIrhKRhhA,i was eager to try this place out  i ate here with my girlfriend  i give two stars instead of one because many aspects of the food were good but my experience here was bad enough that i do not want to come backi ordered pho with tendon and tripe and she ordered bun with chicken as these were both typical vietnamese dishes that we were familiar withboth of the dishes were pleasant if slightly bland  the broth of the pho had noticeably highquality cinnamon used in it and had just the right amount of salt but was a little on the bland side  the vegetables in the bun dish were fresh and had some subtle spicing but that dish overall was a little bland toowhat ruined the experience for me was that the sides of vegetables brought out for the pho were not fresh  the bean sprouts were particularly spoiled with a mild but noticeable rotting aroma of garbage  it was so bad that the first i caught a whiff of it i wondered if someone was taking garbage out in the kitchenbut upon smelling items on the table i realized that it was the bean sprouts  the lime was also not freshit was quite dried out a little brown around the edges and smelled off as well  the hot pepper and basil weren't the freshest i've had but they both were ediblei complained about the bean sprouts being fresh and they said that was all they could do  they brought a new plate but they still weren't freshi would have appreciated that if they didn't have fresh bean sprouts that they told me that they didn't have all the ingredients for pho and offered for me to order some other dish  they also did not offer any refund or anythingno one came later to check on us and ask if the food was okaythe atmosphere here was pleasant but it got very loud with conversation  the walls floors and ceilings are all unpadded hard surfaces making this place seem extremely rowdy when it's even half full  i found that unpleasantit was a little too loud for mei am not coming back  i am loyal to the vietnamese restaurant at 43rd and spruce  it is simpler but it's been consistently goodi've eaten there dozens of times and i've never had anything as bad tasting or smelling as the plate of bean sprouts here  it's also considerably quieter and a little cheaper per item,negative
o7cD_sDA-Evj3Oh0zeH9nQ,2 stars for good food that is cheap but dirty and poor service  after eating nearly all of it i asked for a togo soup container and they gave me a used one that was dirty with a hair in it  when i asked for a new one and showed them no sorry nothing just replaced it  what the  and then i noticed flies around our table  health inspectors might wanna check it out,negative
viVz0HzP-_CbU07HUCquZQ,the food is good and cheap but the customer service needs some big improvements,negative
l4ce2PFU6NWUvJYRZTl6-g,my boyfriend and i decided to give pf chang's a try not too long ago we visited latenight i ordered a moscow mule to start the drink was not enjoyable provided in a glass cup and full of what tasted like old sprite or ginger ale i finished my drink and our waitress quickly stopped by to ask if i wanted another unfortunately she didn't offer the same punctuality about my boyfriend's soda or my water i didn't want another drink for entrees i got the honey chicken and my boyfriend got the mongolian beef our food took such a long time to get to us the food was hot but the wait for the food was so unacceptably long our waitress took a while to stop by the table throughout the time after we got our food until the time we were ready to leave the food was okay i am not a fan of chinese but i was willing to give the place a try my chicken was good quality the prices were steep which i anticipated i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone on a schedule or time restriction i was a bit disappointed to find our experience aligned with those from at least a year ago  that doesn't express a genuine concern on feedback or a willingness to change thanks for reading my review have a great day,negative
VGN37glLit5oxbHIZ837Ag,poor service ok food my boyfriend and i were starving and decided to order some take out we called them and asked for a regular sesame chicken a barbecue pork lunch special and an order of pot stickers they asked if we would like steamed or fried rice with the special as well as which soup we would like we told them steamed and the egg drop soup the call ended fine and 10 minutes later my boyfriend left to pick it upwhen he returned we started unpacking our bag and realized we only had an order of pot stickers and not a regular sized sesame chicken but a sesame chicken lunch special we were both annoyed but called the restaurant right away because we understand that sometimes they forget to put items in the bag and we have partial responsibility to check the bag before leaving when i called the first person who answered didn't seem to understand what i was talking about and kept saying they did give us the lunch special after a few minutes of them repeating the same thing they passed the phone over to another employee this employee quickly became rude saying that we never ordered anything like that and if we would like to get it we were no longer allowed to order over the phone but would instead have to walk in and order then wait the twenty minutes for them to cook it at this point i was furious that they would be so rude about their own mistake so i hung up and decided to just share the food they did give usthe lunch special was nice it came with a cup of egg drop soup and an egg roll they give you about a cup of chicken and the rest of the container is rice the egg roll tasted vaguely like tea which i found very strange but it wasn't terrible the egg drop soup was like viscous salt water the sesame chicken was pretty good but tasted a little oily the pot stickers also tasted like tea which i think was coming from the cabbage overall the whole meal was pretty disappointing and i wouldn't recommend them to anyone,negative
q9JGf4DBh2mN5Qo6XPXBeQ,i have been to countless places for pho in numerous states and this place ranks with the worst of them the restaurant itself is dirty the cook was wearing a filthy apron while delivering the food the bean sprouts were old and brown the peanut sauce for the spring rolls was the worst i ever had my wife's fruit tea was similar to having liquid sugar the only thing halfway enjoyable was the ice coffeei don't know how or why this place got the ratings it did probably from owner and friends since it is a small data set i will never eat here again,negative
YPTYOQO8Lg9BtHsRwYBY7g,worst veggie spring rolls ever it was literally just lettuce that had started to turn brown with bean sprouts no carrots no herbs no tofu and they're charging 5 for this ricewrapped old lettuce i don't understand the service was lacking too i waited for ten minutes for a water refill plenty of staff but many are standing around looking at their phones i remember when i used to love this restaurant what a shame,negative
HWLgmRSRDdUwXFkUxf4N-w,came with a group of 4 all ordered pho there were small bugs in my food i thought it was a random freak thing but two out of my three dining mates subsequently found the tiny bugs in their food as well could almost have been mistaken for large pepper flakes were not the restaurant was apologetic offered to redo the dishes and certainly did not charge us but needless to say i would never going there again i would not feel safe eating there,negative
Bs0JwJEUdfhL-FtLjuu3vA,place was just ok for me tried the braised duck pho and it was not what i expected duck was a bit gummy and the broth lacked something cant quite put my finger on it figured i'd try the regular pho before knocking it and though i enjoyed it more than the braised duck pho it was nothing special once you've tried excellent pho such as the one from a little place called saigon on waters ave it changes your taste buds for good and there is no going back i was not feeling the bubble tea either just not enjoyable i could only do but a couple sips till i threw in the towel service was there ambiance was nice thats as far as i'll go for the money you can do better my take,negative
_KlEMZvay1c9xYctKFtN-w,definitely not your typical vietnamese restaurant if you're use to having quick service this is not the place to goservice wait can range from 30min 2 hour depending on the party size and the size of the wait staff the day i came it was very short staff to the point where customers had to help them restock utensils ask for napkins and remind them that we ordered food they ran out of hot tea if you are a party of 2 or more go elsewhere half your party will get their food finish and you're still waiting for your food also good luck paying you have to flag someone down while you're standing at the cash register the manager was a complete dick he yelled at us for asking for our food which came 1 hr late and some of our food never came and tried to charge us and argue about itfood egg rolls were cold the spicy noodles is sweet did not give the cabbage to compliment the noodles and the combination noodle was filled with oil will i come back definitely not 10 dollars for pho is not cheap save your money and head to the casino you'll have better service and food  tip for the owner hire more servers and a busser to clean and flip the tables faster,negative
PJjkH_VZeQwxEJvlQ-v7wA,it's been a year or two since i've visited this particular pho 75 one of many operating under a looselybased chain and i do mean very loosely  it's not that i thought it was awful it was just that another pho store opened closer to me  from what i can recall pho 75 at 1122 was on par with the pho offerings from other 75's and other random numbers  and then one day this month i was astounded to see the number of people on a given saturday afternoon  during my visits several years ago there may have been one or two other tables that were occupied every time i went  recently it was nearly full  full of nonvietnamese  in fact i had been the only vietnamese patron that day at that time  mind you there is a supermarket full of vietnamese people in the same building while also filling up other eateries in the area  this didn't just happen once  as astounded as i was i made a second visit a few weeks later to find the same results  and then i just remembered there had been a popular man with a popular television program herethe soup is bland  water salt and a tinge of brown  no discernable flavors from any of the key spices ginger cinnamon clove and most importantly star anise  the blandness had to be helped with some pungency from the available fish sauce on the table seems like very little if any was used in the creation of the broth  there wasn't any samballike chili on any of the tables my favorite condiment  the second visit drummed up low hopes and had been confirmedwhat happened  was it the larger number of clientele that diluted the pot  or did they cede to a wider range of palates ultimately dumbing it down as to avoid infringing on softer taste buds  i'm not sure what happened since that popular man visited but it's safe to say i'll stick with my other pho locales from now onanother note i had never been in the minority in regards to chopstick usage at a pho restaurant before  i was astonished,negative
edOq9mAFpg48tI9pwwWNUg,i loved saigon harbor  we figured we would give it a try  it was ok but not even close to being quality of saigon harbor  my kids barely ate the pho soup and they typically devour it  my tofu vermilcilli had ample tofu rice noodles and then some shredded lettuce and carrots  it used to be full of flavor and had cilantro and cucumbers  overall we were disappointed,negative
R4BGGSaz0y5Bq2bCWDQAQg,people who know food have given this place 1 star  not sure it's that bad but 2 is a giftate here had pho  wilted dry basil meat in a blob broth not quite up to par to be generous  they made me show them the menu when i ordered the pho they dont know the vietnamese names and newsflash  pho ga is not beef 'soup with chicken fingersadams avenue is not that far and if you are scared of bad bad philly pho and beyond while not adams avenue quality is close by in willow grove and a much better choicethaisigh couldn't resist  my dining companion had their wonderful  jasmine soup  ginger veggies mushrooms yum  she also had a very south of good drunken noodles  a dish they should have knocked out of the ball park  the noodles were overcooked the chicken was overcooked and it was just not goodanother person commented on the chop sticks  i want to add that the chop sticks have a big taper so there is a gap at the tip and they will not at least in my hands pick up small stuff unless you catch it up further where the chop sticks are not tapered  am i chop stick impaired or do others have this problem toothe place is decorated beautifully save for the fire stand pipe in the middle of the wall service is slow but nice and while i don't think we will be back i hope they do very well to introduce all the unschooled to vietnamese and thai foodif you are angry at my review go here and enjoy  if you are nodding your head in agreement pho 75 pho hoa and pho 38 are much better choices  for thai close by white elephant is the local go to,negative
veNyQ2ObOGTfiVUW_vUFqQ,this place is weird little variety in choices  too expensive for simple crap,negative
IiSXzsFJaFEMTkiUsPFm_g,we went in for pho and chicken vermicelli  let me start with the chicken bowl it was served with dry cold chicken  we asked them to make it fresh the waiter said i am sorry let me heat it up  he returned to the table he had put the whole bowl in the microwave with the iceberg lettuce  we said we did not want it  they continued to watch us both share my pho it was not even severed hot  when we refused to pay for the one bowl that's when they offered to recook a new bowl  let me also add that our spring rolls were missing mint  the waiter was not very friendly  we will not be back,negative
9Pvwx_IfQgQL4ykmlGV6yA,pf chang's  in a city and suburbs overpopulated with chinese restaurants of all calibers one could easily wonder why pf chang'safter eating there one will definitely ask that questioni imagine intergalactic aliens landing for a brief time just long enough to wait 40 minutes for their buzzer to buzz be seated and eat at pfchang's a needlessly two hour process  they eat zoom off in their starship and think hmmm so that was chinese food  then i'd imagine a great race for the only toilet on the ship as the comicallyapplied doses of oil hit themwhat the hell is it with this place and oil  do they have stock in peanut oil futures  to start with your waitstaff will come to the table with a tray holding three bottles of colored liquids  in front of each bottle is a small dish each also containing three colored liquids  your waitstaff will mumble through some memorized incantation inaudible to anyone at the table mostly because the noise in the place sounds like a dozen icecream trucks just pulled up in front of recess at an elementary school fro starving children and mix into the center bowl a small portion of colored liquids from the other two bowls  if you're waiting for a magic trick here it comes  the liquid in the center bowl then gets stirred up and it changes color  then the tray is left on your table for the rest of the meal with nobody having the slightest idea of why it's there in the first place what's in the three bottles what was in the two outside bowls and what is now in the center bowl that has received the magic spell  they might be sauces or components for sauces they might be oils but who needs more of that with this food  maybe they're massage oils  nobody knows  they can't be dipping sauces since there's nothing into which can be dipped into them  are they finger sauces  nobody knows  ancient chinese secret no one tell  it big mysteryour waitress was terrible slow in coming hard to find during the meal and was certainly not happy when we returned all three dishes after finally finding her to tell her that nothing was hot not even the driedout rice  before the entreés arrived we ate two of the worst egg rolls i've ever had small soggy tasteless and filled with what looked like recently mown grass  and at the price they charged i felt as if they should have come with options in those peanut oil futuressothe food  nobody was thrilled  as mentionedthe food is swimming in oil fine tasting but nothing special and not close to worth the price  it's so easy to get better chinese food at half the price in a third the timewhy bother with this dumpafter all that i would like to mention the one redeeming factor about eating at pf chang's  if i ever think of one i'll let you knowgo anywhere else,negative
qWZimITbVwNSGJZsuM47-Q,used to be my default because they have vegetarian broth for the pho now that my pho is sitting on my floorboard i have decided to stop supporting this place until they figure out how to do a togo order jazmine is better anyway the location convenience is not worth the trouble with this place,negative
_NozEKb4y0jkC08DWU8ywA,worst vietnamese restaurant by far the host was actually arguing with the customers for having 8 in the family then the management came with the same results lol they wanted to separate my kids in to 2 tables while the next table has their family of 10 sitting together i hate to say it but by far the worst customer service i had encountered i would not recommend this place to any soul with love ones i have a few greats spots i have visited n i would gladly take my time to help just so the next family do not have to suffer and dine in this restaurant zero star they honestly do not deserve a star,negative
l4ce2PFU6NWUvJYRZTl6-g,there were 5 of us here for a convention we ate at pf chang's tonight because they offer a gluten free menu and several of us are gluten intolerant plus who doesn't love their food we made a reservation 2 weeks ago for 630 we arrived at 620 we were sat at our table 25 minutes later we received our food over 2 hours after we arrived which caused us to be late to our event we had to eat so so fast so i couldn't really tell you how it tasted we did complain and our meal was free so that was a plus but now my stomach is angry and so were we not how we wanted to end our last night here,negative
LbSiWGzV38EDv9E7ttFohw,i was excited when i heard this place started vietnamese lunch buffets  then as i visited i was so disappointed  they had some asian dishes but not really vietnamese  they don't have to copy chinese buffet  all the dishes used chicken  why can't they change some of the main ingredients  they just changed some sauces  i can cook better  no noodle dish or sandwich bread either  soup did not have anything in iti am giving two stars in hope that they will improve,negative
4WdDY97x4GdMYtyk1KQMnw,clueless to what the hype is about when it comes to this place  hate for my first review to be negative but honestly this is some overpriced noodles with egg and cheap chicken or steak  lacks seasoning and food was cold,negative
bfiEKM1pgaupfwfYhwB1Mg,i will start with the positive the food is good unfortunately the service struggles and the experience was poor enough it will be a long time before i would visit them againprices are similar to most decent restaurants serving similar food  portions were very limited not big enough to sharewe ordered duck pad prikh king curry fresh rolls and kids meal  it took more than 45 minutes for the takeout order to be readywhen i got home the 18 duck was not luke warm but cold  the spring rolls were without the sauce to dip and my kid was asleep having waited foreverfor what they offered it's overpriced and underperforming,negative
dvs-RLII_zdcxfjoqOFJzw,although the service was excellent the food was terrible and overpricedi ordered the fresh spring rolls which were rolled too loosely and fell apart in my peanut sauce i also ordered the chicken with rice plate com ga nuong which is my go to dish for vietnamese  places however this was nothing like what i have had at every single other pho noodle house i have ever been to the rice was dry and had some wilted spring onions on top which looked like they had been sitting around for a while the chicken had no sauce or flavoring and was stir fried with onions and red bell peppers it was terrible i stopped eating when i bit into a whole clove of garlic the broth that they served me had tofu in it which i didn't like when i tried the broth it was bland and wateryin addition the vietnamese couple seated next to me tried to order an item pictured on the menu and were told that they don't make that dish it was just a picture why would you have pictures on the menu of food you don't servefor the amount of money i paid this place was not worth it,negative
SJM5bSgqdmAPSiuB4MWNIw,we ate outside served by an ebullient server in one of those tshirts that pretends to be a tux front his enthusiasm didn't quite match his serving abilityhe forgot our simple orders time between courses pushed 30 minutesbut then he was so cheerful that it was mostly okbelow average pho is a headshaking shame the plate of fixins was there but the third and fourth stars from this review are as absent as most of the crucial longcooked ingredients that make pho taste like itself,negative
v6tFMx_fKBcfiBagKb_EIg,literally the worst curry i've ever had in my life the curry is basically a chicken broth soup the chicken is most likely poached in this liquid and it tastes very bland the vegetables are a disgrace the green beans clearly come from a can for almost 13 bucks this is an absolute disgrace if you are looking for a traditional thai curry do not get this if you are looking for edible food do not come here,negative
_22VqZzLBVjhaKfTg70dIA,waited fifteen minutes before being greeted was asked to wait for a table to be cleared waited another ten minutes before finally leaving they were not busy at all only three other tables were taken at least ten open tables i would love to review the food next time went across the street to jade garden was greeted and seated right away,negative

0h4Oo6W8mG4HEYQzZRkoOA,i've been to 10 different locations and this is by far the worst one yeti tried ignoring it but my stomach got so upset and i feel like throwing up i'm from out of state and was craving che so i didn't think much of it bce i always had great experiences from bambu until today i literally ordered in 12 minutes and it came out i saw a big chunk of flour but i didn't think much of it and took it out until i let the cup sit in the car and so much starting floating around it looks disgusting i would not come here,negative
AzylMkpWl-OLWQLMKVRoVg,the staff act as though they are constantly rushed even if not busy but are friendly if you engage them spring rolls were good and their pho is okay but isnt the best i have had the broth was definitely missing something and kind of bland lacked that meaty richness and was very herbgrassy in flavor,negative
8kUh6TROemLfbVR_ewVVLg,i love their papaya and lotus salad best i've had in the city that's the only think i really care for i get pissed off every time come into this place when i dine out i expect to have amazing service and great food with that said servers look sloppy for one proper grooming i'll still waiting for these guys i felt rushed and a bad attitude when i'm placing my order for two when my order arrives servers just throws my food on the table i felt like dog from a third world country gets treated better i did that's third and lastly my condiments and rice looks like they have recycled and transferred to my plates that is disgusting   my friends and family loves this place that's the only reason why i repeating come back to this place otherwise this place grosses me out,negative
p-MSh95si_sDdih94gyKuw,wow this place was incredible we went here for a small round table work dinner off of a recommendation after seeing an article about this place i looked at the menu beforehand and thought it looked really interesting honestly i was concerned it was one of those restaurants that try and put their on twist to everything but just go way to far and everything ends up just being weird boy was a wrong everything i ate was amazing and we almost tried everything on the menu but also extremely unique and nothing like i've ever eaten before and i eat out a lot 1010 recommend this place,positive
BHnCAV4_hgqgNZGdfXNJkA,we came for new orleans jazz festival on the way back home we stopped by this place for lunch parking space is very limited so prepare to park across road under bridge we had to wait on long line to get food the crawfish and shrimps are amazingly fresh and delicious and sauce was awesome but you have to buy it for additional cost the hot sauce is really spicy be careful medium spicy sauce is okay as other reviewers said price is really good it's fractions of fancy restaurant cost,positive
_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,our trip was so short we couldn't make it to commander's palace for dinner but i really wanted to try the bread pudding souffle we called the restaurant to see if we could come in for dessert and the restaurant was very accomodating the bread pudding souffle and apple brickle were both delicious the bread pudding was delightfully light and airy and the vanilla sauce heavenly service was impeccable and i will definitely come back for dinner,positive

_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,extraordinary  the epitome of nola fine dining  the experience of excellence begins at the door as two doormen open the doors to welcome you in  a  greeting line of staff awaits you one on the left and another on the right  after  a brief moment with the host to confirm your reservation reserve in advance you continue to be greeted as you walk up the stairs aligned with greeters at least 20 staff reminiscent of southern hospitality  then you are seated at the dining area  instantly several staff very attentive and intuitive attend to you  in addition rather then requesting black napkins they actually ask if you prefer them over white  boasting about this place would serve an an in justice just rather please make it a point to visit in this lifetime  the food is impeccable and the service is more than outstanding there is sincerity in their way of serving you  i honesty can say i would fly back to just have dinner here,positive
tn1IHhBn5TI4gqSVCbG5fw,literally the best charcuterie i've ever had  great wine selection  fav place in st pete so far,positive
UcKxBL6obtdDhHhTuqmtAA,this place is awesome you'd never know how good it is from its appearance in a little strip mall but man you're missing out if you don't eat here it's thaifrench but really leans more towards the thai side we had spring rolls for an appetizer which were delicious in past visits i've also tried the dumplings and chicken satay which were also excellent i went with my family and all our significant others and everyone loved their food a bunch of us got pad thai with either chicken or shrimp and everyone loved it plus there was enough to save and bring home for leftovers the prices are reasonable for how good the food is plus it's byo so you'll be saving money from not buying overpriced wine anyway the absolute highlight though is the desserts luckily our table ordered most of the ones on the menu so i got to try a bunch the pecan pie is good the chocolate fudge torte with ice cream is great and the creme broulee is absolutely phenomenal one member of our party asked if we'd judge her for licking the dessert bowl clean once she finished her creme broulee she didn't but i wouldn't have blamed her if she didhaha we probably did make it a little noisy since it's essentially one room for all the diners so it may not make the best dateserious dinner place however it's great for big parties and everyone will find something on the menu that they'll enjoy,positive
W8YDBLJkvjVf0VUgXwE8VQ,we stayed at the prince continue hotel and this restaurant is next door the food was awesome and they had a nice variety to choose from we had a friatta crepes and the best grits i've ever eaten the portions are enough to share  definitely a must go ,positive
_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,excellent service and excellent food amazing surprise for an early birthday dinner hubby had boudin stuffed quail and said it was amazing my fish and veggies were phenomenal and the amazing somewhat keto friendly dessert was the icing on the cake,positive
H5KRna9A6mDQEJ2ZN0zL6g,4 12 stars 12 star deduction for noisewe have been there a few times always great food and servicethe only downside is the acoustics  the noise levels really get up there when it gets crowded  which can be a drag when you are trying to enjoy dinner conversationthat should definitely not stop you from giving them a try though it is one of the best restaurants we've been to in the citycheers,positive
iQipfQ4NwfW3SWajgk6S4g,i went last night to try out mark's new vegvegan menu and wow was i impressed my meals there have always been amazing but he added tons of more options i had the vegan french onion soup as well as the korean tacos both were delish i mean where can you get vegan french onion soup the tacos had the perfect amount of spice i loved them both and can't wait to go back my friend had a burger that she loved as well a definite stop for both veggies and meat eatersnot to mention the awesome beer selection,positive
0wZJkj-OnZ7Pmublspl7tA,rico most favorite place for the pizza when to the quarter  pizza here good  the daiquiris pizza other place are big nightmare for rico  here it good  the meatball bread sandwich here is for rico  always come for food here,positive
ZTctPm8-lBy0iJ9dFhYhyQ,we had a very good meal here  it's very lively and it seemed to be full of locals having a great time  the duck confit was crispy and delicious and the shrimp dish my gf had was for lack of a better word shrimpy and delicious  the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that we went to august the night before and it was on another level  plus the sazerac here was pretty weak  service was friendly and goodi'd go 45 stars if i could,positive
BHnCAV4_hgqgNZGdfXNJkA,cajun seafood has a vibe that's a cross between a cafeteria and a carryout because it is both of those things and hot seafood served in a plastic bag is part of the charmexperience  bucking the trend had a grilled shrimp po boy on a bun and a boiled potato the po boy was awesome really flavorful and not overcooked  the potato was kind of bland and didn't soak up much of the cajun seasoning but i still liked it though admittedly i love potatoes and have rarely met one that i didn't like  i also tried some of my sister's boiled crab legs and shrimp which were delicious but only  shrimp were really spicy  i would be willing to eat any of these things again but everything was so good that i'd be curious to also try every other menu item  highly recommended,positive
ZbvSN-_WutRkxhO_abGR2g,great experience wonderfulcharming  intimate restaurant the food is amazing  we had great service i highly recommend and will be back soon,positive
T2JzbrPH2GkY6XpyzNe7ow,wonderful brunch spot we tried the blood orange mimosas the cheese tray croissant french toast the grits plate as well as cortado espresso and the squash spaghetti at the recommendation of our waitress highly recommend it all had never tried blood orange mimosas and will have to make them myself in the future fresh juice but not overly pulpy and perfect champagnejuice ratio the cheese tray was the perfect first course with house made preserves and delicious bread i have never tried a french toast i like better the half portion was the perfect amount to share among other things and it was light but full of flavor the grits are what all grits should be home made with real cheese that's not too overpowering but very tasty the squash spaghetti was the size of a side dish which was perfect for us to share and very tasty with great texture all the coffee looked and tasted great as well our service was really fantastic and food was perfectly timed our waitress was extremely accommodating and offered her recommendations when asked and also helped us decide on activities to do for the rest of the day since we were visiting from out of town the atmosphere is small and homey southern chic must visit if you are in nashville and love to try new foods,positive
wj8XtPyuREj8_0GQz3LZ6w,amazing diamond in the rough from the looks of the outside you would never know what treasures lie inside would highly recommend this place to anyone if you haven't been you are missing out get away from the chain restaurants and support local owned and operated wild garlic grill,positive
kj3Lyh9KooU8GcRBbMDQWQ,this is my favorite lpq anywhere and i travel quite a bit the food is delicious and the staff is very welcoming and attentive i come here every monday with my teenage son for lunch and i look forward to checking in with the staff,positive
cXAKeC-EgVChIxhS7fscmw,we decided to order weekend brunch takeout  easy ordering process through doordash but is a little pricey 45 total for 2 people i had the latin poor man omelette  very garlicky note i am a fan of garlic so enjoyed it with nice chunks of potato it comes with your choice of 1 side and a toast option i chose to get mini baguettes as my toast which were buttered but they did get a little soggy not terribly but noticeable due to being in a takeout container which i definitely understand given these covid times my husband had the corned beef and hash  the corned beef was nicely crispy and came with 2 eggs a side and toast he went with biscuits overall a filling and satisfying meal,positive
p-MSh95si_sDdih94gyKuw,recently had a date night with my husband at forsythia i was a fan of will and was looking forward to our meal here based on other reviews we had a 7pm reservation  and this is probably the most disappointing part of the evening  we arrived around 650 and were not seated until shortly after 730 when we arrived the hostess told us that the table was being set up and suggested we wait a few minutes at the bar while we sat at the bar i looked into the dining room and did not see any available tables twenty minutes later we were told that the diners at our table just got their check and should be leaving soon i'm sorry but that is a very different explanation than your table is being set up turns out we weren't the only ones who waited over half an hour for their reservation as the table next to us told us the same thing happened to themanyhow  the food was fine i think the late seating put a bad taste in my mouth and i wasn't quite able to shake it off,positive
NjD-V9pdH7_V8Y8PGl-csw,tasting menu is so good the server is really knowledgeable about the menu and great attitude we came for valentines tasting menu it's really tasty,positive

eXcJVYGwid2QSaSgR7vYzQ,cool place visiting the area for work was planning on dining at a nearby chain and this place caught my eye the interior was really interesting very open and very high ceiling very friendly staff the wine list was fairly brief yet pretty good selections i had the grilled shrimp app and was very pleased with both that and my entree the ahi tuna which was nicely prepared i would definitely go back when in the area again,positive
hWiXoJFDZrzPY33RjG8yeA,it's been years since i had it but i still think about this potato soup provence had one time with saffron in it it was a cold february day and this soup was so deliciousprovence has lots of outlets around town this one is hard to miss in hillsboro village they have tons of tasty bread which is also sold in our local krogers yay and pastries i've never been to france so i can't compare and i try to be kind to my waistline and stay away from all the tasty treats but man they do look tastyas other people have said yeah it is a little expensive but then it definitely is comparable to bread  company you know the other review that says bread  co is cheaper don't believe it a jambon et fromage at provence 629 bread and company 695 that's just a ham and cheese people plus that's the trick of all these places you take really upscale bread and toppings slap some inexpensive meat inside and voila a 800 sandwich you may complain but you're going to pay for it anyway ok sorry for the rant i'd still rather go to provence bread and company the food company et al than mcdonald's it's at least fresh and made wellso tasty pastries and cookies slightly expensive sandwiches good coffee bound to be one near you give provence a go,positive
XF2SR4yNnIOGRGH9goofuA,i really wish we had something similar to cassis where i'm from and even if there was i'm sure it would be a guaranteed 40 minute drive just for brunch i was in st pete's visiting for the week and my cousin told me this was the spot to stop by downtown so i did what any other tourist would do and went along with himwe got a table outside because it wasn't overly hothumid out yet the hostess gave us menus and we glanced over them for brunch options i don't remember our waiter's name but he was a more middleaged gentleman and he did a phenomenal job at acquainting us to the menu we started off with half a dozen oysters and the cheese plate and for entrees i got the smoked salmon benedict while my cousin ended up with the quiche of the day they also offered freshly squeezed pulp orange juice which we both agreed to getthe oysters and cheese plate came out first and were both super fresh nothing like oysters at 11am right the combination of the freshly baked bread and some of the cheeses were insanely delicious especially with the brie not long after our brunch entrees came out and looked amazing my benedict looked too good to actually eat which was unfortunate because i was rather hungry the flavor combinations from the egg the hollandaise sauce the cream cheese and the smoked salmon was flawless if i could eat this everyday i totally would my cousin's quiche was pretty amazing as well having notes of ham spinach and other greens baked inside with a perfect texturecassis is a great place to stop by in downtown st pete and hopefully next time i'm in down i'll have the pleasure of coming by again,positive
_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,this place is a classic new orleans restaurant and a must go the waiters are extremely well trained and polite the food is amazing it's truly an experience it is pricy but is also a fine dining restaurant great place,positive
_Q3XmBesceFqn9Dk-w6tlA,best mom and pop french bakery in the cityyou name it all types of croissants plain almond pistachio chocolate they got sandwiches and banhmi sandwiches coffee if great too cheaper than other french bakeries and one of philly's top 10 had to sit down after i took a bite of my egg and cheese on a croissant other yelpers that rates this place less than 5 stars must be looking for plain old white bread go to shoprite and rate that 5 stars keep your pedestrian taste buds to yourself,positive
aa2Qz4F80AAFJuUMZMXVPA,when we saw the interior through window we were disappointed no dimmed light a lot of free space white ceramic floor almost like a fast food joint but when we saw and tasted the food we were really impressed it was authentic and delicious real french cuisine we've been in europe multiple  times so hopefully we can be pretty objective judging  the european food we had mixed slate chief's choice combo appetizer buckwheat galette  with smoked salmon and duck breast everything was perfect the owner stopped by to chat the waitress did her job just fine we will be definitely coming there again,positive

El_2Cxuq4hxqrmlg_5nzzA,holy french cafe this place was best experience for food in st louis i would not hesitate to recommend to anyone enviroment is so welcoming cute intimate patio interior has old wood floors that creak as you walk them just so much added character classy place but you dont feel you have to dress the part food is spectacular everything sampled was top notch def a brunch place have morning cocktails mimosas and fresh squeezed on and tea selection drinks 10 of 10sweet beignets  fresh cheese and dried plum compote 8 of 10 little moist interior but packed full of flavor and cheese and plum sauce made it great not typical beignetbrioche french toast  8 of 10 another great dish it is very moist long bath i prefer my french toast on the crispy crunch side but this is not it but still well done taste but the whipped lemon curd pushed this to the top not even needing syrup french breakfast looks like cheese board but was told very good 7 of 10brisket tartine 10 of 10 if they could make this better i do not know how brisket is better than most bbq joints so moist and flavorful bread gives it texture arugula amazing pepper flavor plus everything else amazing dishonion soup  9 of 10 it's done to perfection only mark down is size options lil small enclair 10 of 10 small and cute but damn this thing packs flavor best sweet i think on menu not to sweet but fruity cream amazing great price toochocolate moose 7 of 10 think rockyroad puddingfloating island 5 of 10 it's great but very rich and sweet custard is like a soup with a dollop of murainge centered needs something to balance this sweet ontop of sweet maybe tart berries,positive
I3Uy20BKx7G-Fzz6hLIeWg,we ended our weeklong trip to nola with this place and what a way to go while not as good as commander's which we had done our second night there it was definitely our second favorite meal the service was fantastic and the food was wellexecuted and flavorful though portions were on the small sidethink new york portions in a southern restaurant my fav part of the mean was the gnocchi with crabmeat and black trufflethe gnocchi were like pillows and the flavor of truffle combined with crabmeat was ethereal if i went back to new orleans for a weekend in the future i would go back here and to commander's as every other dinner was a disappointment,positive

RLlOK2fL6xU1sfIPiP2QBw,went to deanies seafood for lunch with a party of 6 the host sat us at a small table which is meant for 4 and added 2 chairs to either side the server took 10 mins to come over and even acknowledge that we were there once she did the experience got better we had an assortment of food the char grilled oysters were good as well as the crab balls and calamari for starters the potato's provides instead of bread put an interesting new orleans flair to the meal then we had the seafood combo bbq shrimp oyster  shrimp poboy and the stuffed grouper overall the visit was pleasant and delicious i would just recommend that the host think about the size of a place setting and the size of the people in the party when seating 6 in such a cramped position,positive
YCPhdj_9t7o_NdN76WKJVg,treats are good quality  it's a nice stopyes some of the treats are a little pricey but they are wonderful a coffee outside in the morning sun is a great way to start the day the ham and cheese croissant is a bargain at about 5,positive

4tU9hlfzrCpcGWTIm-OKVA,i only had the buger and it is very good  their fries compliment the burger very well and head more towards the crispy end of the spectrum than the soft end not much else to say  the service was spot on and eating the burger outside on a nice day was awesome,positive
_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,i've been here many times over the past 35 years  i have always found the service here to be the very best  anywhere  ate here with friends over carnival season and was surprised with phenomenal food and merely average service  we must have had a new server who made several mistakes  the redfish was pure commanders and i tried a different dessert  a pecan parfait that was fun and delicious  most people order the very fine bread pudding souffle which is a signature dish  i suspect i simply had some bad luck with a new server  i had a wonderful evening and the valet parking is a must  recommended,positive
GKcaAbGsobMVhjSFktgVsA,we've been meaning to go here for years we finally made it last week and i can't say enough about it the servers were amazing there was always someone there to make sure our wine glass was not empty we had everything we needed the atmosphere and charm of the place was first class but the food incredible this place is not cheap but it's worth every penny everything we had was made incredibly well and we walked out with a 300 bill and happy with every dollar we will be back soon and the only regret is we waited so long to come here,positive
HUcjSm1Lxdn8zSu-hQ7-sw,a beautiful quiet garden cafe that i found through beyoundbourbonstreet not a place that most tourists could find the oyster salad provides a plentiful number of oysters so full of flavor it is a lovely place to spend a quiet afternoon for a good meal and nice company,positive

4_-IcMpkF_sBRHomWZHNzA,what an amazing experience i had here with my girlfriends we came in for lunch sat outside in a quintessentially french atmosphere and were quickly tended to by a very efficient and sweet server all of the food and drinks were excellent the escargot and the trout over a bed of potatoes and green beans were the highlights for me not to mention a half carafe of perfectly dry rose for 15 and it certainly felt like more than 2 glasses my friends got 5 mimosas and a 5 bloody mary i mean come on i want to tip my hat one more time to service because she gave us enough space was very friendly and knew when we needed something even before we did highly recommend lunch i'll have to try dinner next,positive

RLlOK2fL6xU1sfIPiP2QBw,decent general seafood place in the french quarter they don't seem to specialize in any one food or preparation  if there were 12 stars it would be a 35 1 most of the time you can be prepared to wait they want an id before they give you a pager 2 you have to be a nasa rocket scientist a member of mesa and know how to use a slide rule and navigation chart to figure out how they seat parties it makes no sense at all parties do not seem to ever be seated by either when they arrive or number in the party seems more like a lottery they bring out boiled red potatoes instead of bread a good change up and they are pretty good service is fairly quick for the number of people in the place bbq shrimp appetizer and entree is the whole head still on jumbo shrimp it is sautéed in spices and seasonings you have to peel it it is hands on and messy but goodif you want a sampling of crawfish try the crawfish quartet the crawfish étouffée is really good and the crawfish au gratin is freaking awesome too bad they don't have that as a stand alone on the menu if they did i would order a couple of plates of itthe portion sizes are really large you shouldn't leave hungry,positive
sf-KdXHB5nxfNjl2uUpI6Q,i cannot say enough good things about this place  my husband came across a review several years back and we tried it for our anniversary dinner one try was all it took to get us hooked  we have never been disappointed in the experience here  i say experience because it is the total package  from the always friendly attentive service to the cute cheese grater lights to the interesting reads in the bathroom and of course the amazing food  there's just no way to be disappointed  we went for dinner last night and i told my husband we need to write a review for this place he said why they don't need it i said because they deserve it so here goes  we made 730 reservations and were seated immediately  we were immediately greeted by our friendly waitress whose name escapes me who opened our wine and asked for any other drink orders  we then ordered the carrot soup and goat cheesebeets appetizer  both were fantastic  i don't think i've ever seen my husband eat beets or goat cheese and he gobbled it all up  the soup was creamier than expected but still light and flavorful  we got chimichurri steak and the pomegranate salmon steak was tender and cooked to perfection and the salmon was excellent with just the right amount of sauce  got the chocolate mousse for dessertmmmmmm   our waitress apologized that the appetizers came out late but i swear it was barely 5 minutes  i love that we found this place and it's our spot when we get a kidfree night  try it you won't be disappointed,positive

RTwDv2oLE3gzAZlf63OPXA,i'm so excited i finally got the chance to dine here i'm a member at the gardens and have been here for drinks but never eaten here what a fantastic experience we had the mezza appetizer split the seafood salad had mussels and the quiche as entrees all with a bottle of rosé we finished the meal with the strawberryrhubarb and the coconut rice pudding desserts the food was all delicious only small comment was that the quiche needed a little salt the real standout of the experience was the service yes it's a slowly paced meal which is wonderful when you're enjoying the atmosphere and company the best part was our server rachel she was an absolute sweetheart  helpful and attentive we told her  we were having a special mother's day birthday meal for my mom and when she brought out the desserts they had done a little birthday surprise for my mom it was really fantastic this will definitely be a place i return for special occasions,positive

El_2Cxuq4hxqrmlg_5nzzA,i highly recommend the bistro steak and frites the floating island was delicious as well  meringue is not something i would normally order but this was really good it does get loud though so if you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner for two this may not be the best choice,positive

I3Uy20BKx7G-Fzz6hLIeWg,if only i had enough money to go eat at this restaurant more often we went for the friday special 25person for 4 course meal yes the portions are on the smaller side but the flavors were so intense that it ends up being perfect the best coffee i've ever had the best shrimp bisque i think i'll ever have for my husband's birthday they brought out champagne truffles at the end which were more than heavenly,positive
qF8jkN4q4SajC4p4nKwjgQ,it was 9ish on a friday night and we came with no reservation a party of 5 the maitre'd promised us a table in 20 minutes and we were seated in 19 so far so good we ordered the bruschetta and artichoke dip and my friend ordered a caprese salad for herself all were hot and delicious for my entree i ordered a simple linguini alfredo playing it safe the pasta and chicken were hot and fresh but the cheese oh probably the richest cheese sauce i have ever tasted creamy and dreamy and we had enough for leftoversa pretty reasonable price too the ambiance is cute mona lisa stares at you from every angle the only complaint i could have was that the restaurant was uncomfortably cold the waiter was kind and attentive even close to closing he also split our check 5 ways for us coming back really soon,positive

BHnCAV4_hgqgNZGdfXNJkA,excellentfor their prices they are beyond great i spent a month in new orleans and ate at a plethora restaurants and this was one of my favorites  if your palate is sensitive to salt you might not appreciate some of the food but if you want to taste authentic new orleans food try this place  it is really close to the tourist and is on a main street so you don't have to be afraid about being caught in the wrong neighborhoodyou have a choice between blue alaskan and dungeness crab boiled the new orleans way the shrimp are excellent and the crawfish boudin was rather tasty  it wasnt crawfish season so the ones i had were small but tasty  i had a few shrimp po boys and fried chicken wings from there  if you are familiar with manchu's they have really good wings but cajun's is right behind them  i cannot wait to return to this place,positive
B2KGQwnxjpdY4TIVqmG3XA,service and food were terrific  all of the people there were very kind  i haven't had such a good omelet in forever  if you like an omelet with plenty of filling you will love this place,positive
YCPhdj_9t7o_NdN76WKJVg,we've been here 3 times this trip and have not been disappointed all 3 times we ordered blueberry and cherry danishes which are amazing their pastries are flaky buttery with the right amount of chewiness this morning i also ordered a small coffee and the manager said that with all the danishes we could have a large cup for free friendly but businesslike staff keeps the lines moving along quickly when busy we will be back,positive
Yhla6fekWUwcf3Nkwkg1mg,a group of 5 of us went for saturday brunch and it was delightful normally wouldn't use that would but the service was so friendly the atmosphere familial and the chef came out to welcome and thank us for coming in it's in an historic house and feels like you're eating in a southern grandma's dining room the food was very good especially the shrimp  grits we ordered one for the table to start and they served each of us a nice portion with a shrimp that's the kind of place it is,positive
ETAxDtQbcCmy5ibQ5Y6Glg,first time here and it has been a nice surprise wonderful service with a smile atmosphere is pleasant and not overcrowded the menu is creative and balanced between pasta fish and meat dishes the seafood ravioli was quite tasty the veal was very fresh and tender portions are average but flavors are quite nice all the way through the vegetable sides nice addition to our byob circuit,positive
tthy48ZIX_wfY8Dy0Dvg6w,if you're looking for a nice sit down casual fine dining bouchon is a perfect place to be everything cooked perfectly food runner person was very attentive with taking our dirty plates and silverware and replace them with cleanfresh plates and silverware my server was very knowledgeable on the menu and wine pairings however we were there a bit too long at over 3 hours overall it was money well spent thanks,positive
Iy0CmHZ16A_XCw2nST-Fsg,i can't get a date but if i could i would take her to tangerine for drinks  it's got everything one i would need to aid a guy's my chances of getting a girl to like him me low lighting expensive and strong martinis cozy booths and privacy  i enjoy the 10 liquid creamsicle commonly referred to as the tangerine martini which is made with fresh tangerine puree the setting is created by faux candles above your head which casts the lighting here as soft and mostly orange i'm sure the interior designer would call it tangerine  in fact the entire restaurantlounge could best be described as earth toned  the quiet booths are a great place to have a quiet conversation and the window seats which look out on to market st are wonderful for people watching   tangerine is great place to lounge and take a dateif you can get one,positive
H5KRna9A6mDQEJ2ZN0zL6g,creative and delicious food attractive surroundings and knowledgeable and attentive service the crab beignets are amazing,positive

ZTctPm8-lBy0iJ9dFhYhyQ,we had a very good dinner at herbsaint during our long weekend in nola as we are inclined to do we shared a couple of appetizers  tempura battered blue crab claws and the guanciale spaghetti with breaded poached egg the crab claws came with a house remouladetype dipping sauce the guanciale spaghetti was fabulous  that breaded poached egg adds so much flavor i had the shrimp and grits for my main course  the grits were more like polenta  ok but not my favorite dessert was a cheese plate  a brown butter banana caramel tart man i am still dreaming about the tartas i have come to expect in fine dining establishments in nola we received impeccable service throughout would definitely alot another dining spot for herbsaint on a future visit,positive
XF2SR4yNnIOGRGH9goofuA,the smoked salmon salad is very good decided to try something new aside from a regular caesar salad and i was not disappointed chelsea was our waitress and she was really sweet the atmosphere is nice they have a brunch lunch and dinner menu perfect for all occasions,positive

lqF0Q5vVLxY-_Cth6LtEdg,i visited because i saw that it had good reviews but i'm more than disappointed there were only a few pastries to choose from i went at around noon so they definitely weren't the leftover picks i got two pastries and some croissants to go all of which were average no better than the stuff i could pick up at starbucks,negative
W8YDBLJkvjVf0VUgXwE8VQ,showed up at 245 guy was very rude and said they were closed  we ubered across town to come here but will never come again  lady was nice but guy was super rude,negative
4hWPnJWr1pJYOcI0CGrzWg,went to sunday brunch today  very disappointing outdated room subpar service and brunch menu thats similar to a standard hotel breakfast offering  no carving station no omelet station no labeling of menu items at buffet watch out allergy customers etc  also disappointed with guest adults in tee shirts  shorts  apparently there is no longer a thing called a dress code its sad  green room use to be part of delaware pride,negative

Ro7opPbuSZdL1igdatdTMw,nice quiet bar across the street from metropolitan 5 happy hour burger 5 fries 5 fried pickles food was cold nothing special about the burger tomato lettuce meat patty fried pickles are pretty strange sweet pickle with a beer batter great service but the food has more to be desired,negative
htx6Uime2SkiE-zC7hxb-g,great service phenomenal atmosphere terrible food a little less money on the decor and a bit more effort toward hiring a chef who can at least cook a burger properly and this place would be tiptop but until then i highly recommend finding somewhere else,negative
s366MibRVl4crXpVUX7x9A,went there with the intention of having a delicious meal instead we got mediocre at best appetizers and very bland entrees after our apps and entree disappointed we decided desserts were not worth our time or money service was okay and the restaurant was extremely loud thought i was going to find a gem but instead found a piece of coal,negative
b0zp6rgcv7ZcjToRoVhcmQ,disappointing as hell i left and was still hungry my food was cold when it arrived and it looked nothing like the description which failed to mention a key item hat was on the plate i had the chicken  waffles and there was melted cheese on it for the amount spent the meal was certainly not a match i'll pass on the next invite to patronize,negative
PtFZJdyXZxVO_VXWMLNpvQ,they lie about not taking cards when they do if you just say you don't have cash i got the seafood crepe because i gave up beef poultry and pork for lent no the crab is not fresh liarsssss it is imitation so be warned don't get me wrong i don't mind imitation crab meat but i don't appreciate false advertising the fake blond girl in front doesn't know what she is doing raspberry nestea please sorry we don't have that um it's right there and she almost jipped me of 20 of my change 2nd star earned because of fast service much better crepe places in philly other than here as you may gather i didn't have a good experience,negative
RLlOK2fL6xU1sfIPiP2QBw,every time we vacation in new orleans we go to deanie's two to three times because the charbroiled oysters are amazing we've tried other places but their oysters don't compare to deanie's here's the problemthe service borderlines on shitty the servers don't write down the orders so the first night of our trip when we went there the waiter forgot our oysters and they're pretty much the only reason we go there since we already got our other food we decided to skip the oysters my boyfriend had a shrimp po'boy and i had the stuffed crab the shrimps in his po'boy weren't clean as they still had the poop lines in them and the stuffing in my crab was kinda soggy and there were lots of bits of shells in them that it seemed like i was spitting out shell every couple bites trying to get soda or even water refills also take forever not just this visit either but dammit we wanted those oysters so we went back two nights later this time we sat at the bar which they allow children to sit at which is completely weird to this vegas girl where kids aren't even allowed to stand near a bar we ordered the oysters and just a salad so as not to confuse the nonwritingdowntheorders wait staff the oysters did not disappoint but after we ate and were settling the bill a frickin' cockroach came out of nowhere and ran across the bar right towards me that i actually jumped off my barstool thinking it was going to land in my lap ugh i can't imagine how many roaches i didn't see are lurking in their kitchen now  sadly that will be the last time i visit deanie's,negative
XYwx1tsEB3_G0tgS6l-0PQ,under construction making it difficult to find the restaurant limited menu burger was ordered medium rare but arrived well done and without the promised french fries well after finishing the burger waiter brought out a plate of half done greasy looking fries waiter said fryer wasn't working and the chef had baked the fries sent back fries and was given a small green salad consisting of lettuce and a few cherry tomatoes server and hostess were very pleasant the setting was unusual and quiet the seating was comfortable but the food was terribly disappointing,negative
kFjT5U2RCxNKHqKF_C--IQ,this is truly a toss up between one and two stars i have been here several times and each time seems to get worse i know what you must be thinking  why go back well there are few options in the area for lunch  so it is a necessary evil this place needs a paint job more than the ben franklin bridge the service is usually bad and the food is usually mediocre  but in recent months they have really let things go even the plants inside the place were nearly dead its a great location with pleasant views and if only they would fix up the interior and improve the service and update the menu just a bit it would be a fine place to eat a slow lunch what is truly tricky is that there is a big zagat sticker in the window from this year so one would think it at least has potential to be good,negative
tW85sx5fr8-gCTCOi0c9Pg,menu items are from many other establishments  nothing new staff servers bar probably the worse consistent attitudes i've seen  prices are steep for the quality and weak drinks,negative
F_ker4jxFkcvfZQf-MDfJA,the food was alright  i had some eggs for brunch and it was a little undercooked he barely checked on us and food did not come out together we had a table of 6 the worst part was when the waiter charged our credit card twice very disorganized and pricy for what we got,negative
vV57YWbrHqm1iylWmIdwVA,if i could give 0 stars i would i spent 30 by purchasing tickets online from the website for nothing it was a very bad weather out since it was pouring rain and wanted to change the tickets to come another day when it was nice out but they scammed me by keeping my money i emailed them saying that i wanted to come another day due to the weather but they said that my tickets were not refundable i will sue them may you rot in hell for stealing my money,negative
sr-5EY6bmp4jINhea06MjA,very disappointing waited 3 months for reservations to celebrate my daughters 16th birthday they were out of main desserts our waiter was not friendly or helpful at all a great server would have made the whole experience so much better we were there for about 30min total and spent 120 once was more than enough and we've had much better cake at other places,negative
_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,to pay topshelf prices for well brands is extremely unsatisfying that's the commander's palace experience i hadn't been to commander's since around 1983 during a recent trip to nola i thought it would be a treat for my family to eat there remembering how wonderful it was back in the day so i booked us reservations and eagerly awaited the meal i told my family how delicious the food was and couldn't wait to share this experience with them i cannot tell you how disappointed we all were the build up was perfect we took a car service to the restaurant and were dressed in some of our finest clothes we were seated immediately and were greeted with prompt friendly service we each ordered some form of starter after hearing many rave reviews i ordered the turtle soup the food arrived right on time and was still hot there was only one problem which became the theme of the evening the food just didnt taste good i sampled everything at the table and didn't like a thing don't get me wrong there was nothing wrong with any of it the food wasn't cold there wasn't a hair or grit in anything it just didn't taste very good now you may be thinking that i am being overly critical because this was a fine experience there was wonderful service and atmosphere well let me quantify this by saying that i've eaten at denny's many time i've had many good meals there my meal at commanders was far worse than anything that i've ever had to eat at denny's i'm so disappointed,negative
QA8QLpwf_YT9C2ST5YJ0vw,for the price we were extremely disappointed with the quality of the food we started with the oysters béchamel and had one bite the quality of the oysters was so poor they tasted horrible even through the bacon and fried crust i got the crab au gratin and every bite had a piece of shell in it the hashed potatoes were extremely salty but that was the best thing we ate service was ok while it's a beautiful place to eat we will not be back,negative
9h0i4lVC5eCVhRTanWsEAg,keep trying to make this darling restaurant work but service is so bad food is ok once you finally get it forgot we order food wouldn't prepare it the way we wanted it they said all preprepare it therefore can't change anymore sliders thenoverchargedwhen we brought it up they said your right it is on this menu for 42 not 53well the menu we had it was 20 and 2 of us sawit at 20 but they just said no you are wrong we are charging you 53  well you are wrong we paid the 53 and for the 1st time in my life no tip  so after tonight it is official i will never returnstrike 4doneruth's kris please come back,negative
tthy48ZIX_wfY8Dy0Dvg6w,overall experience was disappointing however the rock shrimp that topped the dish were very grainy as if they had not been properly cleanedthey were completely inedible the local venison was very good but my lamb was poorly executed,negative
_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,although the restaurant and atmosphere are beautiful i would not recommend this restaurant for vegans  we had a party of four of which three were vegan  i called three times weeks and days before to ensure the restaurant knew and could make interesting meals for us  i spoke with jimmy who advised our reservation would be noted there were vegans in our party and that commander's palace had experienced chefs that would make an interesting new orleans inspired meal for us on the spot  we simply had to tell them what we were looking for  after the third call he said i could ask the waiter to speak with him if there were any questions on the evening of 2417 as he would be there at 7pm  i told him it was important we had a new orleans inspired meal as that was the reason we traveled from ny to such a awesome city  our waitress was curt and noncompromising  she bordered on being nasty and said that there was one vegan item the chef prepared ahead of time a vegan risotto  i advised her of what jimmy told me and asked if she could speak with him  she said there was no other option and that speaking with jimmy would not make a difference  needless to say the risotto meal was lacking in flavor  it was bland and far from capturing the essence of new orleans it was one of the worse meals i have ever had  very disappointing   i went to several restaurants during the week and there were amazing vegan options  i wish i had gone to one of them for my birthday that night,negative
FYgFwsb9w2_2VyyUuld23w,they have a retail portion as well as table seating i tried both bought some small tarts and had them boxed up nicely for my customer they made a very decent shot of macchiato it took them 25 minutes to finally get my order of openface turkey and avocado tartine maybe today was an off day but seems like a recurring issue of being out of ingredients and long service times i was told they were out of ingredients for a special menu item also overheard another table trying to order belgian waffles and was told they were out of waffles  kind of strange for a breadbakery,negative
XF2SR4yNnIOGRGH9goofuA,went for brunch with a few friends and this place was the most overpriced and sub par in  food and servicei had the meat omelette  was cold  meats were just folded into the egg  came with no bread and by the time we got bread the eggs were cold  server forgot to get salt pepper and ketchup and that was also a good 10 minute wait  it was so bad that i took two bites of this cold  unappetizing tasteless food and left it  my wife had the croissant sausage egg and cheese and it was worse than dunkin' donuts sandwich for 55 dollars for two people this place is one star or should i say negative one star,negative
TzNk1TcWLZn0JCpO83hBAA,since i had been here before with wonderful service and food i suggested this to my friends for dinner as it turns outthe waitress and the food were very disappointing the waitress was a nervous wreck with a fake smile trying to compensate for the lack of other servers to help customers it took forever for her to come by and when she finally talked about the specials  i ordered one she nervously said that is the last one and suddenly hurried off to the kitchen to confirm the order then she came back to the table to announce that she had secured the last dish and take the rest of our orders we felt neglected all night and the food took forever and didn't come for at least an hour we were not even consulted about why our food was taking so long when the food finally did arrive my chicken special was dry and flavorless and lukewarm at best it appeared as if the rest of the meals were cooked fresh but mine must have sat for a long time after the food took so long to receive i didn't feel at liberty to order anything else so i sent the dish back and felt upset i instead said what is the fastest thing you can bring so the rest of my guests will not feel uncomfortable while i had nothing to eat and ordered the soup it was just ok but the meal frankly was a disaster and when the bill came i felt even worse when the waitress explained that food never gets sent back to the restaurant and that was maybe 1 of orders making me feel even worse for not receiving the lukewarm meal then she proceeded to say that the entrée had not been charged and that that dessert was free  however it was clear throughout the night that the waitress was not on top of her game or if the cooks in the kitchen this was extremely disappointing as i had suggested this restaurant i will not be back i expect better service feeling someone's nervous and frenetic energy all night is not the reason i go out to a nice meal,negative
lS42krxXMm-HIk7dntRsKQ,this is the worst place in the world staff is so rude they disappear take forever to take and bring your order the food was bad and not worth the wait save your money go to china town bad bad bad,negative
fjPsBdE-5ORzbEZ5pnloRA,i went to patou on st valentines day and it ruined the whole night the service was awful and it took 2 and a half hours to get served the waitress forgot our order twice and the wrong food was sent to our table when my entree finally arrived it was served on a dirty plate with residue of someone else's dinner on it disgusting disgraceful disturbing and never again,negative
e86IBzGCsrnhJbD_wELj7w,have been to herbie's a handful of times and had decent food went back last night for dinner and had the scallopsduring the course of the dinner my front tooth was chipped on a shell from the scallops which obviously we're not prepared properlyi stayed calmed and collected which obviously was a mistake our server josh was greatthe manager sean however was not i went to the restrooms to look in the mirror and snap a pic of itas i came out i was approached by sean who try to tell me he don't see how i could have lost part of my tooth from the scallopwe exchanged phone numberswhen the bill came i was still charged for my meal when i approached the manager again he said well i thought everything was oki said so i guess i have to cause a scene for anything to be done about this  won't ever be back fair warning management doesn't give a crap,negative
5QsipB9-N4RMj94c-CvwUw,i had been here before and was previously pleased with my time today it was terrible the server made us very uncomfortable the salt and pepper fries were disappointing the burger was not flavorful like before and the place was hot and had terrible vibes we will not be returning anytime soon also a 5 dollar burger is a good deal but it's 2 dollars more for fries which sucked,negative
Exh1uNhTSDR1hGivZBIylA,i ordered the four course meal and was disappointed with my experience for the second time for how much i pay i will not be returning after some of the worst service i've experienced and mediocre entrees my friends suggested it after fqf because our reservation for elsewhere wasn't for another two hrs and although i had previously been and left unhappy with the service i thought i'd give it another try last year when we went for a birthday dinner the waiter was so rude about us bringing the birthday girl cake splitting meals etc that she left in tears after his treatment toward us this time we had the same waiter who made my friends feel inadequate for asking questions about the menu and for requesting more bread my drum topped with crabmeat came out room temperature while the creme brule was nothing special to top it off my friend pointed at a roach on the floor and while we prayed it was just an olive it started crawling beneath customers' feet pros the complimentary bread was delicious and the coconut cake was to die for moist light and not too overwhelming of a coconut flavor pretty interior and an option for outside if the weather permits,negative
9h0i4lVC5eCVhRTanWsEAg,slow service  takes a while to get your food had a very undercooked hamburger it was likemush served to me never tasted something of that consistency before it was pretty gross got our appetizers with the meal not before would not go back,negative
0wZJkj-OnZ7Pmublspl7tA,don't understand all the positive reviews not impressed at all i've had many a frozen pizza that was of higher quality and far better taste  also far too expensive for what you get if you want really good pizza delivery in nola you'd best try somewhere else and when you find it be sure to let us formerny pizza snobs know,negative
24f-qQokEN2UvBNHMWLm3A,antoine's came highly recommended by a friend we were sadly disappointed the host and hostess acted like we were lucky to get in and they were put out to seat us even though we had reservations there were many empty tables they went out of their way to not make eye contact we were dressed appropriately but they acted like we were street people we ordered a sazerac and it was a small drink for the price with no garnish the bread was basically dropped on our table in a sack as a waitress strolled by our main waiter was very friendly but everyone else acted like we were invisible or like they were unhappy we were there we ordered the fish recommended by our waiter and it was just ok pompano with lump crab a bit greasy my friend enjoyed her escargot the potatoes au gratin were diced potatoes with a runny white sauce very unremarkable the other side dishes a very dense wedge salad and deconstructed shrimp salad were just ok our total with one drink and two glasses of wine with tip was 150 each i wouldn't go there again the restaurant may have been wonderful at one time but has seen its better days,negative
XF2SR4yNnIOGRGH9goofuA,very slow service took forever to get just the appetizers then when they came we discovered that nearly a third of the muscles were empty and the calamari cold and to top it off my entree was cold and had the incorrect side,negative
tthy48ZIX_wfY8Dy0Dvg6w,not as expected for a french restaurant it's a california new style cuisine was expecting a traditional french cuisine,negative
ZCURd9PiH4qdEjQfrIZzFg,i gave 2 stars because the servers and bartenders were relatively nice my boyfriend and i walk in at 840 which is slightly late i guess but when a restaurant stops serving food at 9 but stays open for drinks after i figure we have plenty of time after perusing the menu i didn't find the burger which is the only thing i've heard is good here so far i ask the server if it's possible to order the burger he returns to tell me after i've ordered a drink and we've been given food menus to tell me that the chef doesn't serve food after 9 i look at my phone and the time is 847 i was pissed i just got up and left i mean what the hell my understanding of this place is that the owners are wealthy and not really trying to make the restaurant a successful business but more of a place that they and their friends can hang out at i might've thought that the people working just wanted to leave because it was a slow night or something but the owner was right there and clearly couldn't give a crap that he wasn't providing the service that his restaurant was supposed to,negative
HQUq4glxPzoi5zNqbNfTDA,we had a birthday reservation for my niece who was turning 30 years old party of 10  we were seated in the upstairs areaso completely ignored by the staff we waited over an hour to finally get our first course which was short 2 wedge salads we complained and was told they ran out of wedge salads lula was unprofessional an rude she blamed a bad waitress and dismissed us like children we left after 2 hours with no entrees served what a disgrace truly poor service with no apology from lula herself she needs to be more humble and cater to her guests i can tell you this place was a big disappointment,negative
_Q3XmBesceFqn9Dk-w6tlA,i was imagining a lively and charming bakery but was met with an empty and modest shop  they sell baguettes pastries and hot coffees and teas  perhaps i should have come earlier in the day but i found the afternoon baguette to be very dense and stiff almost cold  it would have been thoughtful of them to toast it but it was not a personal slight  all in all i can understand why the locals appreciate the neighbordhood bakery but i found nothing particular to warrant a return trip,negative
_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,wow wooooooow this was a big miss for me i wanna preface this review by saying that i came here with very high expectations commander's palace had been a place that was talked up by several of my friends that had been to new orleans several times so i was very much looking forward to the occasion i was told that they had amazing food and that they were the best restaurant in town after my visit there i can't say that any of that was true and i cannot recommend going it should also be noted that i came here for lunch not dinner so perhaps dinner service is more what my friends were talking about but i have a hard time believing that dinner would be so radically differenthere we goi went to commander's palace after a pleasant tour of the garden district tour ended around 1230pm and i headed straight there after i'd recommend you make a reservation if you go i went in cold considering i was by myself and it was a lunch hour they were very nice when i went and were able to accommodate me without issuei sit down sans menu it's a few minutes before anyone comes to see me so i sit there and stare around the dinning room for a while i notice that the place is not very well lit the awnings outside are down blocking a most of the day's natural light perhaps by design to provide patrons a bit more privacy the chandeliers are fake with fake lights and fake candles i thought that was a bit odd considering this is a fine dinning location or so i thought the chandeliers are like massive versions of the fake tea candles you find at restaurants pretending to be high end i also notice that everyone in the place has a name tag like you're at a waffle housemy server stops by and she lets me know that they have 25 martinis i think that's amazing i order a commander's palace martini i still have no menu and i'm starting to wonder when one will be provided no matter i'm enjoying a bit of people watching someone brings me my martini and i give it a go it tastes a bit like an alcoholic version of a blue icey you'd get at a bodega in queens not a big deal just thought their martini might have a bit more balance to it soon someone else brings me some garlic bread there's nothing special about the garlic bread it tastes like regular french bread with garlic and cheese on it in all honesty it tasted like something i had had before it took a while before i could put my finger on it but then i did it tasted like white cheddar popcorn you know the one i'm talking about the one that comes in a bag at your local bodega like doritos maybe it's my unsophisticated palate but that's what i tasteda menu is finally brought to me and it's a laminated diner style menu laminated paper the apex of new orleans restaurants has a laminated diner style menu i choose the classic creole lunch this includes a turtle soup appetizer a quail entree and a bread pudding dessert the turtle soup had a great deal of flavor but i didn't care for it much it came with a small loaf of bread which i used to sop up a bit of the soup not the best thing i've ever had but i had high hopes for the quail quail comes and i take a knife to it before it falls apart to reveal it's mostly stuffing the stuffing was ok but i was really looking forward to a well cooked quail there was some quail but it acts as more of a retainer for stuffing the bread pudding was maybe the best thing of the three main dishes and it was honestly just a bread pudding souffle you're likely not making this at home but it's nothing you haven't had before you'd sooner get a cinnabon from the airport and feel just as good about itafter finishing my third martini i start really pondering what the heck is going on is this fine dinning laminated menus name tags on all the employees then i see a nice waiter come out with a dessert and a chef's hat he puts it on a nearby patron and then takes a picture of him i ask later if it was his birthday and he responds yes and adds if i'd like a funny hat i pass this pinnacle of fine dinning operates the same way a tgi fridays does or that what it seems like i'm surprised they didn't sing a song and dancei ask for my check i sign the check but never hearsee my waitress again it seems like we're all done and she's not concerned about anything else at my tablethis was a really odd and disappointing experience maybe if i had just come here blind with no expectations i'd have been ok but considering the fact that you should have a reservation and there's a dress code and it has a great reputation i expected moresave your time save your money and go somewhere else so far my favorite restaurant experience was restaurant august,negative
ZKi4F9BlA46rLvLyeIE3VA,i ordered scrambled eggs and bacon the eggs were dry and over cooked and bacon was burnt when i asked about my food the waiter was very defensive saying no one ever complained before then he took my plate and asked me to leaveof course from any reputable restaurant i would expect an apology and an offer of something else on the menu this restaurant should not offer dishes they don't know how to prepare stick to crêpes i doubt the omelettes would be any better,negative
j8NhrBzy1op0BfVGdSOiXQ,a shop which says coffee in flashing leds has coffee from a thermos that too luke warm and it finished after pouring half a cup refilling the thermos took more than 15 mins never here again,negative
24f-qQokEN2UvBNHMWLm3A,food was good servers recommendations were uninspiring signature dessert was a bit dry  service was good enough,negative
GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw,this place is insanely overrated  i guess it's good if you're staying at the hotel and it has a super convenient location but otherwise i would avoid it  the food isn't bad but one of its best qualities is that it won't make you sick  i'll pass next time i'm in new orleans and recommend you do the same,negative
vuE1iseFrgNPumUEfHIZZQ,given the high ratings i had higher expectations for jj thai dropped in on several occasions but alas i had to classify jj thai on the overrated liston the hunt for the best pad kee mao aka drunken noodle i decided to try it here  my rice noodles weren't as thin as i thought it should be and did not seem freshly made  they were rather clumpy some pieces weren't separated but stuck together  the lack of noodle separation inhibits flavor profile as rice noodle by itself is kinda bland and requires exterior seasoning  as the protein pair i chose chicken and it was really dry  it seemed like my chicken was cooked already then mixed in andor just cooked too long as a wholeon another visit i tried a fried roast duck entree based on the recommendation of the server and it was just prepared terribly  the duck meat was devoid of any moisturejuicyness as a result of being overcooked  the exterior duck skin was inedible  i ate the thicker interior meat or what i could chew and left most of the rest behind  quite frankly this duck should not have been served and constitutes the base of my lower assessment  while my server wasn't responsible for the outcome of her expensive recommendation when i informed her that the duck was overcooked it didn't seem to elicit any reactioni'm in the minority here based on the high reviews here perhaps consistency was an issue on the nights i've visited but i'm used to great thai with great flavors and preparation  jj thai isn't on that list,negative
XF2SR4yNnIOGRGH9goofuA,after walking around for the last two hours we decided to take a stroll on the waterfront area of st pete as is customary on a walk we paused for a drink and snack we found this cute little place with its café exterior which reminded me of photos of parisbefore i go further it's good to know there are two cassis locations the café slash bakery and the restaurant we did the formerwe went in to discover a treasure of treats from croissants to cakes we ordered i got the almond croissant and ordered an espresso drink two of the four did and for very prompt attention one ordered an iced tea which seemed to stop the entire operation no one knew about the tea after a full 10 minutes of waiting it turns out that it was powdered anywaywhat was most annoying were the outdoor accommodations what was cute turned to barely comfortable when you put two microscopic tables together and a smoker chains away her life two tables away perhaps these laws don't vacation in florida either,negative

4tU9hlfzrCpcGWTIm-OKVA,i've been to eat here several times and had lunch there today  first of all the service was fantastic  no complaints there  the food not so much  i had the pulled pork special which was mostly roll and very little pulled pork  honestly there were more pickles that pork on the sandwich i didn't eat the roll so got to see how little pork there was once it was 'deconstructed'  the tiny little side of slaw didn't help to quench the ol' appetite either  they brag about their black truffle fries but they came out cold and soggyi normally like this place but this time it was pretty bad,negative
XF2SR4yNnIOGRGH9goofuA,this was the worst service i've had in all of st petersburg possibly anywhere the staff was rude impatient and extremely unpleasant our server acted angry with us whenever we asked for anything when he walked away from the table he shook his head and made faces like he was annoyed with us and we weren't even asking for anything out of the ordinary in addition to the terrible service my daughter's pancakes were uncooked on the inside i will never eat here again,negative
_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,special day todaya friends birthday who had never been to commander's and then later her engagement partybeing a locally born and raised 62 years i was thrilled to share this beautyi've celebrated many an occasion at the restaurant but was sorely disappointed todaythe service was sosobut was highly disappointed in the food caesar salad was way over salted and shrimpgrits were luke warm as were all the entrees i commented to our waiter that the grits were like paste and shrimp cold but got no responseafter spending 277 gratuity not included for three i will be dining elsewhere in the futurewhat a shame to loose true locals,negative
RLlOK2fL6xU1sfIPiP2QBw,my friends ryan had been to deanie's before and said he liked it so we decided to give it a try while visiting nola i have to say that this was one of the worst dining experiences i have ever had here is my break down of deanie'sservice 0 out of 5 when we first arrived it was an hour and a half wait to be seated this made sense since it was a busy saturday night however we didn't get seated until close to 3 hours furthermore our server was awful which pains me to say since i was a server once and am always a pro server guy she brought us our waters soon after we sat down and didn't get refills until well after our food came out when we needed something water the salads she forgot to bring etc we couldn't find our server anywhere in addition and i am not a big stickler for this but our table never got cleared during our meals ie the appetizer plates were left stacked on our table during our entrees overall as you can see i don't think i can find one nice thing to say about the service hereatmospheredécor 1 out of 5 i found deanie's to be very trashy food was all over the floor and the tables around us were dirty food 3 out of 5 i ended up getting the crab quartet which was not all that great i love crab but did not really enjoy too much of the food the best part of this entree was probably the crabmeat au gratinoverall i would not ever go back to deanie's while visiting nola there are too many places around deanie's that has the same if not better quality food and much better service,negative

RpFCCPbTSDWFL_nT7KKLvg,chez leon has moved from it's former location in the cwe to forsyth in clayton the new location is very formal dark walls white linens lots of wealthy seniors in suits fill the tables i'll be honest i used to like their food but it isn't what it used to be it reminds me of what hotel caterers would serve a few tasty sauces but mediocre meats cooking technique and presentation my waiter was pretty mediocre too no enthusiasm boring and inattentive i got more attention from the bus staff they did work hard to squeeze us in at the last minute but overall it's not for me,negative
RLlOK2fL6xU1sfIPiP2QBw,first place we ate in new orleans and it just wasn't my tub of butter i felt very sick after eating the bbq shrimpit was swimming in butter and after eating i felt greasy and gross the place was packed our waitress was very nice but the food just didn't taste good too much grease and the shrimp was incredibly hard to peel felt like they were overcooked i left with a stomach full of butter and burnt fingers from trying to peel overcooked burning hot shrimpnot the place for me,negative
HQUq4glxPzoi5zNqbNfTDA,way overpriced meal and we never mind paying the price for superior fare my cobb salad was just mediocre i think the lettuce was out of yesterday's bag my husband's quesadilla was actually charred on the outside and he said it tasted burned the ice tea was either old or too strong the service was good until we went to leave and then she was on the phone chatting for too long i cannot recommend this place,negative
LVgJDRNT7XE-IpfDlP0WAQ,very disappointed with the food out of 7 dinner meals 4 were bad and 3 were just okay pork undercooked entree not served complete food served cold and sauce watery and without flavor burgers were just okayit is a cool looking place but food not good,negative
tthy48ZIX_wfY8Dy0Dvg6w,i live one block from this restaurant and have only eaten there one time that should tell you enough it's been a few years so i guess it's time for me to give them a second opportunity but usually when the service is really bad and the food is not spectacular especially in contrast to the high prices i don't give them second chances in santa barbara where there's so many other wonderful experiences to have i will update us after i try it again but it may be a while,negative
FYgFwsb9w2_2VyyUuld23w,this place i dismal do not go please here's whyto start off with the service was horrible i ordered by phone and still had to wait about 20 minutes after i got there and what i couldn't understand is why it took so long for them to prepare my meal or even initiate contact with me when there were about 10 employees just standing around behind the counteri ordered an organic belgian ham sandwich with a 3 french mustard blend and i can't even begin to describe my repulsion upon opening the box my ingredients were strewn about the box over the bread in a chaotic fashion my three mustard blend was something my 3 year old could have made because it was simply and that's the nicest way of putting it french's yellow mustard olive oil and some poupon sounds pretty good you say that's what i thought until i picked up my first forkful of sandwich with the fork that the restaurant didn't give because they didn't give us one i guess it wasn't included in the price the bread was soggy and tasted like they got it at walmart did not taste anything like freshly made bread the ham was okay but it was so salty that my dermatologist thinks i might be getting cellulite from that dreadfully small portion the lettuce was soggy as well and tasted like it had been out for a day and well that's all the sandwich had in it and it was all for just under 16 dollars plus tax if you like horrible service and overpriced good food go to le pain quotidien or in english the daily bread i can tell you if you have your daily bread here you'll be bankrupt and malnourished before you know it,negative
dfROZ3-RWFfB2b-QMgorjg,couldn't wait to get out of this money pit  i believe the management feels the same way as they rush a massively overpriced low quality meal  one piece of advice is to stop by costco on your way and get some chicken meat and cheese  with that bulk you might walk out of there feeling like you ate  if you read other posts i seldom have complained about cost as long as there is a positive correlation with quality  this was not the case  i spent as much on the meal as i would have going to sur la tabla buying a highend fondue set and then hitting a 5 star butcher and seafood market the food would also have been good which was also not the case it was not the final straw but all the straw that the restaurant rushes you through this campy disneyworldlike experience  it is a definite gem for the area and a place where people clearly go for an experience child's birthday dinner addiction to bland greasy food or as a recipe for being in just too good of a mood but like vegas you leave feeling empty and cheated do not go unless you win a dinner at a charitable auction to help some better cause and even then,negative
I0I2mkCOPTYVSLpc8A8VVw,the service was absolutely deplorable i cannot believe the disrespect that i felt from this so called award winning restaurantmy friend and i were seated slightly intrigued by the menu and asked for drinks to give us time to go over the menu because it's was quite unappealing and difficult to understand given that our waitress explained nothing because we seemed younger than the crowd that was there we were not given the same respect and service as the other customers we were not given the complimentary bread andor refills of water just as every other costumer were given and when we asked for our check after waiting for 35 minutes after being ignored we asked to close our check and she already had it ready for us with the apprehension that we would not be dining at all we found it rude and disrespectful given that we had given no indication that we were done dining in that restaurant she obviously made a poor judgement and lost sales for the restauranti would not recommend this restaurant under any circumstances even if you are staying at hotel no 77 there are many more dining options on the same street that would excel expectations unlike this one,negative
0jgDSv2SOvCiOuqShsNtlQ,my wife and i went here since it was so close to our hotel but found that the food did not meet our expectations  the service was okay but the food was bland oily and though we did not order two sticks of butter our food tasted like it anywayalso the only other people inside were 23 detectives which would ordinarily make you feel comforted but not these guys  they reminded me of the crooked cops from the movie the big easy with ellen barkin,negative
JRa60aO_ZZCdfDIU6IlpCA,we live in the neighborhood and eat out a lot so we know the local scene balise had terrible service we told the servers that we had an engagement in 90 minutes expensive vip seating for the endymion parade when we sat and we asked several times about the status of our meal we were getting ready to leave when we got our food after 75 minutes even through other parties seated after us got their food first the manager offered us dessert on the house as we were trying to gobble our meal and rush to our event when we said that wasn't helpful she said she'd take off a round of drinks from our check but when we got the check nothing was taken off they made us really angry the food was just ok and so we will not be back epilogue they added 30 to our credit card slip after we left because we undertipped absolutely disgraceful,negative
24f-qQokEN2UvBNHMWLm3A,my partner's mother and aunt were in town so we wanted to have a special evening out at one of the french quarters finest and oldest establishments only antoine's would do we secured reservations for friday evening and practically ran the five blocks from our home to their front doors when it finally came time to make good on them we opened the doors and stepped inside the room reminded me of those old style art deco french cafes that have the pale green porcelain tiles and mirrors everywhere inviting and fitting for such a restaurant i thought then we were greeted by the maître d it wasn't actually a greeting he glared over his glasses at us and asked coldly if we had a reservation i informed him we did and gave him our party name he raised one eyebrow at me and said let me check and slowly perished three pages on his list before finally saying i suppose you do he snapped his fingers and a waiter came over to guide us to our table they sat us in a half empty room that amplified all sounds ten fold it was like being in an elementary band practice room our waiter came by and in a very uninterested tone asked us what we wanted to drink using the want word is a big don't in fine dining it's always like never want anyway she took drink orders and left twenty minutes later she set drinks down and left again by this point all water glasses were empty and we asked her for refills fifteen more minutes go by and another waiter drops off cold bread and melting butter ten more minutes and our waitress comes back without water to take appetizer orders we go all out and order half the list thirty minutes go by and all the appetizers come out at once with still no water and no offer for more hard drinks ten minutes later we had worked our way through the bland rather disgusting looking oysters rockefeller oysters royal undercooked shrimp and wilted salads we wait for the waitress to come clear the plates ten more minutes pass before i have to flag her down to get those water refills clear the plates and take entree orders we order steak veal lamb and red snapper it takes 45 minutes for entrees to come out and keep in mind the dining room is still only half full and the restaurant honestly seemed very overstuffed for that evening still no water at this point i break nice face and sternly tell her we've asked three times now for water and haven't gotten any she silently walks away and comes back ten minutes later with a pitcher no ice my 59 tiny pathetic bone in ribeye steak was cooked extra rare when i ordered it medium and suffocated in pepper the veal and lamb were also very under done and the fish was actually completely over done and drowning in spices the side of broccoli was just that a single stalk for 8 the creamed spinach was cold and the grits hard i was in shock i simply couldn't believe how awful the food was i've seriously had better meals at longhorns and that's saying something we sheepishly finished our main courses and waited for the tabled to be cleared after another 25 minutes of being ignored i grabbed a bus boy and told him i wanted the bill now he told me to sit back down and the server would bring it to me after five more minutes i grabbed someone who looked like senior staff and told them i wanted the bill that instant and i was tired of being ignored he rudely informed me that they were very busy and we're doing their best at this point all bets were off with me i was livid it took every strand of self control i had not to start screaming i told him i required the bill immediately or i would be speaking with the manager our long lost waitress finally emerged at that point with the bill i instantly handed her the card she brought back the bill and without so much as a curt thank you threw the bill on the table and walked away i drew a huge black x over the tip line i stared at the total 49685 my jaw quivered it was literally making me sick to my stomach to know i was about to bleed out that kind of money for the experience i had just gone through every part of my brain was screaming for me to call the manager and tell him i wouldn't be paying a thin dime for any of it but i didn't i knew if i asked to speak with a manager i would probably leave the establishment in the company of the new orleans police department i signed the bill holding back the revolting steak i had choked down earlier never again will i ever go back i'm still in shock because i have worked in so many restaurants and seen so many unimaginable situations unfold before my very eyes i let a long of things slide when i'm out to eat even in 5 star restaurants i like giving everyone the benefit of the doubt antoine's broke every service rule i was ever taught every last one of them it was unreal and from one of the oldest restaurants in the city it's very sad they are obviously only riding on their name at this point,negative
IoihJkcF2FcE-sHOneat-A,no wonder they had a table at 7 pm last minute when no one else did  things must be harsh in the restaurant biz because they can't afford to have some roasted vegetables ready to nibble with that glass of wine  no all is cooked to order and that meant one full hour while we sat there waiting for the first edible besides bread not warm after the hour i tendered a little inquiry and then got excuses and rebuttals  sorry never entered into it  finally they condescended to comp me my club soda all of three bucks off a hundred dollar tab  no manager on a saturday night and it shows not fun not happy and not even that good  always depressing when a favorite goes south,negative
Exh1uNhTSDR1hGivZBIylA,waste of money  we came here for a late easter lunch  the service was not great and the sever rushed us because the kitchen closes between lunch and dinner  we had a reservation  maybe don't take reservations if you need to rush the clientele the food was average there are just too many other restaurants in nola to try  we will not be back,negative
73ZXjIfdHJs59XOzKHQ45g,i don't recommend it  prices are high  my service was decent but i wouldn't write home about it  our bill came to 180 a head  just a waste of money,negative
fOhnSqmO4XY5vSI8whVKSA,a very modern menu to go with their modern looking restaurant with exposed ceilings windowstreet seating and bistroesque vibe slightly on the higher end of the money tree but i was satisfied with my crabcake it could of been bigger though the bread caddy is a nice touch i wish the quality of the bread was a little better most of it seemed dry and stale good effort for ambiance and slight fusion in the menu our server was very knowledgeable about menu items which was really refreshing possible that dinner is not their forte i want to definitely try this place for brunch,negative
L6LiIjKsMcxguEGnr5ilqQ,my third visit here and it keeps getting worse my first visit was awesome great service great food second visit long wait for anything sketchy service great food third time awful service missing food extreme wait times it should not take 2 12 hours for a meal let me say up front the food and drinks are great always small portions expensive but very good quality and well worth it however service is horrible who is to blame partially the wait staff but  also the kitchen and whoever does the staffing just don't come here unless you have all day to spend i had the devour downtown menu and started off with the charcuterie so my plate was missing the salami since it only has one meat on there i really wanted that part so i alert out waiter and he looks and confirms no salami and takes my plate let the wait begin after about 15 minutes he comes with another attempt and disappears before i can even say something now this looks even more pitiful and half empty  well now i do have salami but no bread or berries or pear as i had on the previous plate this should have never left the kitchen like that so again i alert our waiter since i really would like the missing items eating jam without any sort of bread is just not my thing and so i wait most folks are  pretty much through their appetizers so i get up and ask the hostess for a manager i explain the situation and he said he would look into it another 10 minutes or so and i finally had my plate with all items on it the manager did look at what had been served to me and agreed that it was a sorry excuse it had been a good 45 minutes to an hour by now my friends were getting restless and famished waiting for their main dishes i was ok now since i had food haha in your face i probably could have auctioned off morsels from my plate to the hungry at my table eventually our main dishes were served and hungrily devoured then the wait for dessert began most of us asked for our bills and dessert to go because it's been over 2 hours already there is only so much time you want to spend in a restaurant very frustrating and personally i will probably not be back unless someone else pays for it now for the food on the devour downtown menu  the charcuterie plate is small  but the items once you get them all are very delectable the cheese and salami excellent pickled cucumbers refreshing with just a hint of pickling the whole grain mustard exquisite the fresh berries and pear slices livened up the whole selection great stuff and if it wasn't for the wait i would happily eat it again i chose the pork option it was seasoned well had quite a bit of umpf to it also the green beans were perfectly cooked and the smear of gravy had an interesting flavor a well made dish no complaints whatsoever highly recommend it for dessert i had the strawberry pot o crème light creamy goodness wonderful i could have eaten about 10 of them in all honesty in a nutshell the restaurant is beautiful but incredibly noisy the service leaves a lot to be desired to the extend that i will likely not return the food and the drinks are absolutely spot on,negative
nn5tvvgFtnoyCocACvXmJQ,a terrible dinning experience remarkably slow service we ordered two dozen oysters at 175 per oyster and the 24 might have been equal to 6 normal sized oysters we will never be back,negative
JtLgjIFEPqw38jTqn1H00Q,when we walked in all the employees were joking around doing absolutely nothing but laughing cursing and using the n word to each other extremely unprofessional not a care in the world i get in line and ask an employee about the duet and her reply was just look at a menu the menus were all sticky and nasty and i told her that she responded with rolling her eyes it took 22minutes for my food to come out and the entire time i had to watch the kitchen prepare my meal i had the feeling like they were messing with my food because i asked another employee one simple question not once did i see a manager present but if there was one on duty i'm going to blame them the employee that i questioned about the duet was the same one that rang me up and the receipt says makeshar that location needs to be retrained on sanitation food preparation and customer service,negative
w-0Gm5hKaX6mHRXoA0Ylrg,meh bathrooms were dirty there was no soap or paper towels to dry hands drink came out with lipstick on the glass food was barely okay the bisque came served in a plastic to go container and was lukewarm chips with feta and green onions weren't cooked long enough and the chips weren't crunchy at all muffuletta wasn't good at all either  left a weird taste in my mouth i didn't want to eat anything for fear of getting sick,negative
CvhOKuu-uUDJRj-7mcbbvw,okay so what i think a lot of people forget is that when this place opened up in the 90's and before it got all the hype from their ny times reviews this was just another run of the mill pizza joint for anyone who has been in its current state it will probably be hard to wrap  your head around but sovana not only had typical townie pizza place menu items they also delivered the restaurant slowly evolved into what it is now and while obviously they're very successful in how its running now there yuppy atmosphere and insane prices are a little bit too much i have been to sovana countless times in all of its stages of progression and there were pros and cons to all of them most recently however i had what will probably be my last ever experience with sovana bistro i used to order their chicken caesar salads alllll the time in high school college and after i graduated and they were always really delicious albeit on the pricey side i knew that i'd be spending more than i would for the same thing at pretty much any other restaurant in a 10 mile radius however last week when i called in a togo order for my fav chicken caesar salad i was super excited that is until i got to sovana to pick up my lunch and the little high school girl behind the counter rang up my total 2248 that's right over 22 for a fricking salad with chicken that is more than the cost of a bag of three full hearts of romaine a quarter pound of gourmet parmesan cheese a pound of boneless skinless chicken breasts at the grocery store combined ever since they got there big name reviews the prices have sky rocketed along with the egos of whomever is running this place charging that amount for a salad with a very very small amount of chicken is robbery especially when the chicken has more char on it than when i forget about something that i left on the grill i paid for and ate the salad because i was hungry and didn't have time to order and wait for something else at a more sanely priced establishment but you'd think for that price it would be the best gd salad in the world but nope i will not be going back any time soon if at all,negative
wj8XtPyuREj8_0GQz3LZ6w,you've been warned this place is over priced has horrible service and what's worse the food made one daughter sick at the table and the other daughter refused to eat her favorite food in the world shrimp after only a single bite was talked into salmon menu said 16 but on the check was charged 26 each explained the problem with food and check and was only given a dirty look and the check for 90 no offer to remake remove foul items from check or anything we only ordered the fondue which tasted dirty and smelled 2 salmons and an appetizer shrimp with 1 ice tea that also had a weird smell to it for 90 and there is no atmosphere this place is a dump inside and out i would never refer even someone i hated to eat here okay maybe someone i really hated but they would have to have killed my dog or something major like that like i said you've been warned,negative
RLlOK2fL6xU1sfIPiP2QBw,this place sucked  it was recommended  but the service was atrocious   they threw my salad on the table then screwed up our entrees  we told the manager we would only pay for our drinks and appetizers but they only charged us for our drinks  the only good experience,negative
GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw,disappointing  we went for brunch on a saturday after reading some good reviews here  the food was ok but overpriced for what it was especially a dozen tiny west coast oysters for 45 but the real issue here was the service or the lack there of  we had to chase the waiter down several times to refill water glasses and to find out why 1 appetizer came out right away but we waited 10 minutes for the oysters and bloody mary's  burgers were ordered rare and medium but came out well with cold fries we assume the problem was the burgers were cooked before the appetizers were even delivered to the table  overall can't recommend when there are so many better options in new orleans,negative
lS42krxXMm-HIk7dntRsKQ,food isn't that great it's over over cooked and had a bit bitter taste to it price is reasonable but not worth it very disappointing,negative
XYwx1tsEB3_G0tgS6l-0PQ,ate here last week with my husband the lobster salad was great  the reason for 2 starsservice was not friendly our waiter seemed to rush us and took my martini that was only 65 finished he didn't even bother to ask if i was done with my drink he also never refilled our water glasses we had to ask for more water after one glass was completely empty i didn't expect this lack of service at a nicer establishment i really enjoyed the food but got a bad taste in my mouth due to the poor quality service,negative
tW85sx5fr8-gCTCOi0c9Pg,just had lunch at lola and i have to say i'm pretty disappointed  after all these great yelp reviews i was expecting moreit's thursday and the place was deserted when my friend and i got there just before noon only two other people came in while we were dining the waitress was pleasant and gave us plenty of time to decide and there looks like a ton of great things on their menu it's pretty hot  humid so i decided against the lobster corn dog wmac  cheese which was what really intrigued me instead i got a sandwich  the medusa spinach  feta spread muenster mozzarella white cheddar and roasted tomato on sourdough plus a side of frittes my friend ordered antoinette strip steak gruyere onions  mushroomsroasted tomatoes says something to me other than sliced romas which is what was on the sandwich it pretty much tasted like a grilled cheese  tomato which isn't  bad but i was thinking there'd be more green on it from the spinach spread it was way too cheesy for my taste though it was definitely a tasty grilled cheese sandwich the fries were warm when they came out but cooled quickly my beef with any restaurant that serves fries is that they should be served in a cone like belgians do so they stay hot not lola's fault that we're not in europe i suppose though a good idea should be crosscultural they were definitely homemade and had the slightly greasy consistency of really good homemade fries quite tasty the bread was fresh and grilled just right  very tasty breadjay's sandwich was a big disappointment the meat was tough and one piece of it was half gristle no one wants to dismantle a sandwich to cut off the gristle  then reassemble blech why serve thatit wasn't that it was bad but for the price  all the good reviews the place has gotten i just expected more if someone suggests lola in the future i'll go and try something different  maybe a crepe since that's why jay loves the place and that's what he usually gets but i won't be craving it between now  then,negative
xwKYBPO0ByGlkvNcr8FdqQ,the grand marnier soufflé is fantastic but pretty much everything else is low quality and overpriced everything is coated in butter as the sole seasoning there are many higher quality restaurants in town at or below their price point the service is extremely slow and inconsiderate even by tucson standards if we return it will only be for that soufflé,negative
wMWRpzjKgwIef2yJ41RCGw,having recently come back from a year in paris we were craving the french pastries we had grown to love when we found la bonne bouchee we thanked our lucky star unfortunately we were sorely disappointedthe napoleon was burnt and i couldn't even cut it with my knife the baba au rhum was compact sticky and lacked any rhum neither the napoleon nor the baba tasted like it should the pastry chef should be replacedservice was inattentive prices were not in line with product and service quality we will not be going back,negative
9h0i4lVC5eCVhRTanWsEAg,this was one of my favorite restaurants in santa barbara it has the perfect patio well furnished interior and the food is excellent sometimesi let the last few visits slip and figured it might have been a funk today was the worst experience i've had and it will be tough to come backlike some of the last few visits you got my fries wrong if you're going to offer 3 types of fries on the menu it might be beneficial to confirm which ones were ordered i cant see how anyone could eat any potato fried in anything but truffle oil when offeredgenerally food is exceptionally fast considering the complexity of flavors in said food lately it has been slow and the flavor unacceptable we always visit during the off times when maybe 23 other parties are in the restaurant with us it's unacceptable to take twice as long to prepare something then normally expected we order the same thing every time and it takes 1015 mins max lately it's been stretching 2535 minutes completely acceptable during peak times however when there are 2 other people in the restaurant and you hear the waiters and cooks joking around in the back it's clear they have too much time on their handssad to see you fall into typical santa barbara complacency,negative
jl38yx7zzMRbg-kOK8NLDw,i have been hearing about how good the germantown cafe is for a long time and finally had a chance to go there for lunch the parking lot was very convenient and we were seated right away as we anticipated the lunch crowd and went there early before 12 i was excited about the salmon sandwich in their menu and decided to try it i had a small caesar salad before my sandwich and was not impressed with the salad but the real disappointment came with the salmon sandwich well let me put it this way if your eyesight is not sharp you won't be able to see the salmon in the salmon sandwich the salmon piece in the sandwich was probably about 14 inches thick maybe less my eye sight is not that good the sandwich looked more like a bacon sandwich and less of salmon sandwich  i don't know whose idea it is to put bacon in a salmon sandwich but it is not a good one at least i don't like it i am giving germantown cafe two stars based on my single lunch visit but will try to go back to try some of the other things in the menu if so many reviews say it is very good i must give it a second tryon the positive side there is a place that sells very good chocolate right next to germantown cafe so in case you are not happy with your meal at the cafe as was the case with me you can always stop by for a couple of truffles next door actually that is what i did and the chocolate was the best part of my lunch  i left germantown with a truffle smile on my face,negative
xwKYBPO0ByGlkvNcr8FdqQ,short on service and even when asked to prepare something a certain way due to diet restrictions i had to keep sending it back,negative
GG-DeOjnmu4V_opx-MIfvA,on the one hand who wants to make their own fondue when the melting pot does it so well but on the other hand who wants to pay these prices for really crappy wooden service in new orleans which is a service town the food is good of coursebut it's corporate food my main beef with the corporate thing here is that i've been to melting pot restaurants in three cities now new orleans philadelphia and washington dc and i get the same hard sell in each city using the same script that leaves a bad taste in my mouth it would be much more successful and decent for customers if each restaurant were allowed to have their own independent service culture i've also had pretty bad service at the new orleans location and the kitchen is routinely out of whatever i really wanted case in point last night no veg for the cheese fondue eh accessibility notes fully accessible for mobility devices restaurant gets very loud even during nonpeak hours no braille menu or signage,negative
_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,commander's palace has always been one of my favorite five star restaurants with flawless service and exquisite cuisine but i'm afraid it's now just another nola venue that's simply floating by on its reputation i brought a very special guest who travels and dines in 3 star michelin restaurants on a regular basis and was sadly disappointed as was i with my longtime favorite first the ambiance was horrendous as the attire was not indicative of a peaceful highend dining experience instead the garden room was as loud as frat party at semester's end we could barely hear the waitstaff and they were consistently misinterpreting our orders the presentation was sloppy with what appeared to be either fingerprints all over at least one dinnerplate or perhaps the finish was so marred it should have been replaced my risotto appeared as if it were literally slapped on a plate with no concern for aesthetics everything was so rich and nothing tasted healthyeven my salad was drenched in so much dressing i only could stomach half of it it was a birthday dinner and even though we did get the balloons and chefs hat a complementary bowl of ice cream basically was soup with hardly barely enough firmness to support the candle finally i was using a 100 gift card with 7540 remaining the receipt came back showing only 5040 remaining on the card and then 0 so i guess our waiter who was friendly but more of a workthetip type provided a 25 tip in addition to my 20 tip all in all an uninspiring experience although the crème brûlée was flawless,negative
SjiRaZoWaDpkCCpq5SsrMw,i came to this place on a recommendation of someone and granted i'm from here so i know where to go but i wanted to try something new so i didn't make a better recommendation upon arriving apparently the staff doesn't communicate with each other because he wasn't aware of the phone call where we changed our reservations then the waitress was completely rude taking our orders and it was completely rushed what i love about the quarters is hospitality but this place is absolutely horrible i'm waiting for the food but the service makes me want to cross this off the list,negative
El_2Cxuq4hxqrmlg_5nzzA,brasserie by niche as a restaurant had a lot of potential food wise it would be a solid 2 and half stars for what we had experienced and i was willing to give another shot but the follow up was extremely rudeinsulting that i am here typing this reviewing with lots of detail as the general manager jennifer m requested we went on a saturday and the wait wasn't terrible for a table considering how busy the place was for about 5 minutes we got a seat the ambient was pretty pleasant by far our server i have to be very clear that i didn't just make this up was a close to 6ft blonde middle age male we didn't get greeted for 10 minutes but finally get our drinks ordered i don't know why juicing fresh oj and grape fruit takes another 10 minutes but we finally get our drink but the guy just ditched us and not taking order about another 15 more minutes later we finally were able to put down ordershusband ordered something with egg and potato i had a hamburger food didn't reach us for a whole hour our waiter did not wait us a single time in fact folks who were not suppose to attend our table ended up helping us more since we kept on grabbing them so we could get our emptied water glass filled during the time we witnessed a few groups come in and left possibly with impatiencefood finally came it was good but not 1 hour wait good we were so hungry we finished them in 15 minutes again never got attended by our waiter and we have to ask a very nice guy to hunt for him twice so we can pay and leave another 20 minutes of waiting the guy came with the wrong bill had to grab him againi left a tip about the terrible service we encountered and was quickly reached by the general manager instead of waiting for my response yelp removed my tip claiming that i did not leave enough detail about my experience i did not do so because i hate to lower your star of your restaurant review and would actually give a try out for the dinner your other waiters were seemingly nicer instead i got my tip removed and i wondered whyso here you go and we would be no longer interested in visiting again,negative
_Mbw_orl5EdXJP1XzklQvA,this place was very odd and i can't say it was a positive experience because she got a coupon my mother and i went here for dinner it was the first time i'd been into this particular restaurant in ten years and immediately i recognized a musty smell when they led us into the front room it literally smelled like a chuckecheese the carpet was dirty and obviously hadn't been cleaned recently okay sooooo a server didn't observe our existence until like ten minutes in its a small crowd and the majority of the restaurant was literally empty the whole back half including the bar and we had to flag the waitress and ask for waters unprovoked mimi's used to serve a nice warm assortment of breads before your meal now they serve two sad dinner rolls no taste with margarine it used to be real butter had to flag one down again to place the order i ordered this chicken and mushroom thing with mustard sauce my mom ordered grilled salmon and quinoa with vegetables her food has literally no seasoning whatsoever and the quinoa was severely undercooked vegetables had no seasoning mine was not a mustard sauce rather straight dijon mustard on some pasta and chicken the chicken was the only thing i could really stomach okay then at  the end of the meal the waitress finally decided to grace us with her attention by arguing with my mom saying we had to buy drinks to use the coupon even though there was nothing at all in the coupon about that being a requirement so my mom refused the waitress raised her voice and was like youre wrong then starts trying the read the fine print to prove it she found nothing but did not apologize they were also playing like sunny 1069 pop hits from the 80's 90's and now for a dinner service super weird uncomfortable ambiance barely palatable food and the waitress we dealt with was super rude they also wore no name tags so even if i wanted to i couldn't name them beware i'd give it 0 stars this place used to be fantastic,negative
htx6Uime2SkiE-zC7hxb-g,service at the bar was just ok we got a tuna narcoise salad which was very good didn't like seeing foie grass on the menu  i'm an animal advocate so that didn't sit well was good to check out given they're fairly new beautiful inside but just overpriced  not one of our favorites probably won't go back,negative

wj8XtPyuREj8_0GQz3LZ6w,so went in and it wasn't super busy got seated right away but that's about as good as the dinner got the wait staff ignored us the whole time only a party of 2 when our food came out the potatoes were cold and with a huff the waitress took it back and heated it i would like to think i'm not one of those tables but wow now the lamb was good i'll give it that but i don't think it was 30 good the service is what killed it for me doesn't matter how good your food is if service sucks i won't be back,negative

ZCURd9PiH4qdEjQfrIZzFg,the remodeled patio and interior looks pretty nice  my wife and i had just finished dinner at another restaurant and were walking by maggie's and i wanted to stop and take a look at the menu since i had not seen it yet  we had been talking about giving it a try after it had been open for a few weeks  the hostess at the front an older gentleman who appeared to be an owner gave us a couple menus to browse and after a few pleasantries i commented that it looked good and we would be back another night  his response was ya maybe in about 30 years  my wife and i just looked at each other in shock that he was implying the prices were too expensive for us  granted we look young since we take care of ourselves but are both in our early 30s and very successful professionals  if that is the attitude you want to present at the front of your restaurant i can guarantee you will not be around long  my wife takes clients out to dinner 4 nights a week in the downtown area for her organization and has already scratched this place off her list  i will be sure to share my exchange with all of my wealthy clients as well  not a way to succeed in a small town like this,negative

HNMN7NhEvA64Z0FDEA2Twg,been coming to liangs for years and it is still the best orange chicken i have ever had egg rolls are excellent as are the crispy cheese puffs i have never had a bad meal at liangs,positive
9o55tW2eCwxRvwWVQSzj5g,good not great food byo cozy outdoor dining area great place to take a first date  trio is not by any means the best thai restaurant in philly or the best thai food i have ever had  however it's not as bad as some of the reviewers before me have said  i've been here a handful of times and it's been an overall nice experience  most recently i brought my date there on a friday night  it wasn't busy yet so our service was near perfect  the waitress was knowledgable and very friendly  we split the house salad a spring mix with asian pears and candied walnuts  nothing to get excited about  then we split the sweet corn fritters which were pretty tasty  i had the crab cakes and my date had the drunken noodles  both good size portions and damn good too  overall we had a positive experience and left satisfied,positive
jL3R9dm_1sLRCAdINzpJDw,absolutely delicious they do a great job with the classics like pad thai but also have since unique dishes and great curries i find the express to actually taste better then the full stores,positive
UU503tMXdZR4oDZXuoKuGA,this is my second visit and it is  again delicious thai spring rolls followed by red curry chicken was a good blend of flavors and we'll satisfied me,positive
V7-YzHrBVY8lLHaG_kS7AQ,best thai food in webster gyoza and spicy basil shrimp are my favorites great for take out and comfortable spot to dine in,positive
w520vYWEpEYBf90rSr9NVA,i went today and had the daily curry which was peanut based with potatoes pineapple chicken water chestnuts and different vegetables  more indian and less thai  i'm glad i went with my choice i absolutely loved it  my friend got the phad thai with tofu she was hoping for a little more oomph so make sure you request your level of spiciness before ordering  being a little more pricey that most local thai restaurants i would hope they would make up for it with some kind of roll or soup with the lunch special but it is an additional charge  had that had been part of the deal i would've definitely given 5 stars  very friendly staff as well,positive
HCYs4zgL7kCLdEqKRqaPbg,i love this place the guy working the front cashier is hilarious might have been the highlight of our trip lol but as you walk in you can see the menu up front above your head or grab a menu when you're ready to order you wait in line for a single cashier but the service was very fast wine was delicious and food is wonderful it can be spicy for some but they warn you before you order location is a bit odd but just adds to the quirkinesses of the restaurant highly recommend,positive
jA7MZB1aMgQaiNzIdhkwZg,my bf and i went here around two pm on a saturday the restaurant was lovely and dim cool and quiet i had the sashimi deluxe 16 pieces of chef's choice sashimi in an elaborate presentation the fish was delightful fresh tasting and served quickly he had the spicy roll combo and it was also beautifully presented he said it was delicious and the small piece i sampled had wonderful flavor our meals began with miso soup and ginger dressed salad the waitstaff was excellent and i'd be a regular here if i didn't live so far away perfect,positive
89SD5fNDDnJj-ITB40hLsQ,just wanted to update my review because i went again last week and ordered the spicy noodles which were soooo good definitely bumped this place up in my eyes,positive
RTOIDrDonj9tgYHHSTuu-g,great thai food in the 4th street gandy area  lunch specials are affordable 7 9 and prepared quickly usually with 15 minutes  i usually get take out during the week and the staff is always very professional and friendly  food itself always is fresh tasting and perfect lunch sized portion  spicy designated dishes are not painfully spicy so make sure to ask for extra spicy if you like your thai food fiery hot,positive
NXbsRaSCuPKbcCuTVHA57g,definitely more authentic flavors i've had since arriving in philly moderately priced portions are generous and on a summer night a very cool byob perch to people watch from,positive

dobrhbpdxTMh9EWiTEQk7A,tucked away in an unassuming storefront on terminal square sabaidee is the real deal in thai food sure you can get the pad thai which is amazing but they also offer 4 different curries all of which can be made with tofu as well as a selection of meats the chef was both knowledgeable and accommodating to make items vegan i had the tofu app without the fish sauce and it was great but it's the curries where they really shine i had the massaman curry so flavorful with a coconut milk base with fresh pineapple and hand carved veggies the 69th stterminal square neighborhood is a hidden gem of amazing asian cuisine rivaling south philly and other corners of the city sabaidee fits in well,positive

8RGqaro54LVUOZpiTefWZQ,third thai place ive been to here making it 2 good ones out of 3 service is prompt had the spring rolls curry chicken skewers and pla chu chi was surprised the spring rolls came with no meat instead with fried tofu the sauce was a sweet and spicy one instead of peanut sauce it however had a better variety of vegetables in it which made it just barely enjoyable the curry chicken skewers were good though i would have preferred more color and curry flavor lastly the pla chu chi was a red curry with cod fish filets i loved the curry loved the cod am unsure how i feel about the two together overall i enjoyed my experience,positive
o2ETM4XZXENkzuAaYT2GIg,had the panang curry and it was just hot enough to be good it was a good amount of shrimp which were well cleaned  liked the crab rangoon,positive
gjbmwlYUImb2lQBp5LV3KA,all around incredible experience  i highly recommend maypop for those who want to get out of their comfort zone i can't wait to get back,positive
VXFS9fqs7Dgt4WeeBw2SYw,wow i can't believe i'm the first to review this place not only is their food freshly prepared and totally delicious it is cheap my boyfriend and i had their early bird dinner special available monthurs before 7pm which is soup or salad appetizer and entree for 995 our total came to only 26 after splitting dessert heavenly fried bananas with coconut ice cream  chocolate saucethe service was friendly helpful and prompt the food was served with the kind of elaborate presentation that you expect at a center city establishment the interior was spotless and completely revamped with high ceilings comfy seating and cute thai decor i really cannot recommend this place enough  it's equally great for a group of friends or an intimate date sorry if this sounds like a sales pitch but every time we've gone it's been strangely empty and i would really like to see more restaurants like kao tip find a welcoming home in the northeastother plusesclose street parking is almost always available metered out front and free side streetsit's a byob with a wine store right across the street,positive
fzBcbK539fhZ6cZVp90vEQ,this is hands down the best sushi place in nashville it has a two rolls for 11 and you cannot beat that anywhere not to mention the same guy makes all the rolls so it is a little slow but it's definitely worth it i will return many times,positive
H9Qk48EFNBwFiRd7bw-K4A,i don't know where to start  first of all they have the best sushi for miles  the owner lee and his wife cindy take customer service to the next level  they know most of their customers by name and they even know what they order  it is not uncommon to get a complimentary appetizer when you dine in or carry out  it is byob which is always a plus and if you happen to bring some beer order the salmon skin hand roll it is one of my all time favorite rolls if you can't decide on which rolls you want go for the maki combo 3 rolls of your choice and soup or salad  my wife loves the angel roll and lee's peking duck is legendary one of the greatest things about orchid is they serve chinese japanese and thai dishes and everything is delicious  i almost forgot the pineapple chicken similar to general tso's but totally different and amazing from the outside it looks like your average chinese restaurant but once inside the food and service is everything but average  visit orchid and tell him that mike sent you,positive
9e_rrzyTolsH1RUXHOvsMA,loved loved the thai food here first time i got it and it was soo good  and it was take out ,positive

S3W5FolQsYjvwWTkc5yWxw,my family loves this place the pad thai is wonderful  chicken satay is super tasty  the artisan sushi on their web menu though they stopped serving it 2 years ago so don't get your hopes up,positive
VbzoVWEPSfzaIGBq4KlVwQ,went here on a recommendation from a friend about some tasty curry was not let down the restaurant is nice and cozy inside i order a pot of jasmine tea and it was nice hot and relaxing i drank it all so fast and my waitress pat l went and refilled the pot for me right away which was nice she was very good at making sure i had everything i needed without overcrowding me while eating also very nice i ordered the gyoza appetizer and the red curry with chicken for my meal both of them were hot delicious and filling the menu had other things that sounded tasty might have to come back for some pad thai,positive
EVqumzu_CSGws7XMTCl5og,great thai food in a pleasantly shabby location in the heart of nola's nicest district tasty food huge portions totally recommended,positive
AODksDNj5mH953cyhUG1Qw,hands down my favorite thai place in tampa and it's a plus it's right near my housei always order the penang curry and the papaya salad non ripened papaya tomatos and carrots with fish saucei lived in thailand for almost a year and this place definitely comes as close as it comes to authentic the papaya salad is always so fresh and tastes so similar to thailands authentic dish the service is great the staff is super friendly you can call ahead too which i recommend as they do get a lot of to go orders,positive
s9__MGvr-D6mj9HT8xRVtQ,so hungry for thai red curry perfect spiciness and very fresh vegetables and succulent shrimp perfect dinner my son had the shrimp with broccoli and loved it  he's 8 small victory for mom,positive
rnioJAG4aQp2TJHUxLy7CQ,love the chicken pad thai always good every time i order i will say i was disappointed with the rib tips  they don't get you many and a lot of fat on the rib,positive
-1B9pP_CrRBJYPICE5WbRA,drunken beef noodles are always my go to great take out as well big portions this is one of my favorite places in the city rock shrimp is very good as well,positive
uMVOtr16r1ELu46pWr4HCQ,one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in reno great atmosphere quite comfortable really fast and polite service and wonderful food always my first choice for thai food,positive
Ptq4bgynZgnqgyx2FQbVWw,the three rolls for 11 deal is hands down the best qualitytoquantity sushi ratio on the main line since they've shown up i don't go anywhere else for my casual sushi needs it's casual dinein or togo the space is functional and clean not flashy staff is always friendly and accomodating  they ran out of a certain kind of fish once for one of my online orders and called me immediately so that they could make me something else and were happy to substitute an offmenu rolltheir online ordering form isn't pretty but it's accurate and efficient unlike other places with other uis and who knows what happening on the backend vic's has never f'd up an online order from me,positive
89SD5fNDDnJj-ITB40hLsQ,good food but a little disappointed with the quantity of food for the price ordered a few times from here and their spiciness level fluctuats depending on who is cooking i assume all in all i recommend trying this place for yourself,positive
cGWhF0eEogy0DKPwCU9TtA,the chicken pad thai is excellent here great flavor always consistent have had it several times their service is great as wellthe location is kind of an odd place not close to most of the other restaurants and there is a smell of smoke from the hub bar next door for those reasons it's generally empty inside but it has a pretty nice atmosphere great if you're working late downtown and need to grab togo or maybe for a really quiet date i feel like they would do better if they were located right next to pizzaiolo bavaro same type of market or around where five guystaps is and obviously without the smell of smoke,positive
564SxwIj6xXa8QRApKew5A,i was really happy with this experience the concept was very different and this noodle kitchen has more of a thai influence i love thai food but i've never had it presented to me like this before where you can choose your sauces and toppings it was kind of coolfirst of all you must get the thai iced tea it was creamy and sweet a great combination i decided to get the soup bowl with sweet potato noodles they have many different types of noodles to choose from and they also sell packages of noodles these noodles are freshly cooked and prepared in front of you i selected shrimp as my protein and bone marrow as the broth you can get veggie broth here for those who are vegetarians i also got the kale bok choy bean sprouts and carrots for veggie choices there were other toppings like garlic oil crispy shallots different type of peppers lime green onion and so much more all of these combined ingredients tasted very good together it was a very healthy and comforting meal there wasn't a lot of salt which was great my ring finger didn't swell up that's how i know when there's too much saltthey also had about 5 different hot sauces at the sauce bar a coworker friend of mine tried the pineapple hot sauce and he said it was very hot so a dab will do you depending on how hot you want it to be they sell their sauces as well i may go back and get some for my husband who loves hot sauceit's true that the broth by itself is kind of bland but the whole purpose of this concept is to make your own unique flavor combinations i was very pleased with what i chose as the toppings the bowl was huge it's definitely more like 2 very large servings the price was high but i think that has more to do with the type or combination of the proteins selected the mini bowl is definitely the way to go if you want something under 10 that's what i'll be getting next time i'm looking forward to trying different toppings next time i may even add some hot sauce for an extra kick,positive
L2bYnTMtQwSn7Z-W8ZL8fA,this place has been a favorite for a long while there are too many great dishes to name with the addition of a sushisashimi bar i'm sold the jasmine tea with honey is the best simple drink they serve basil leaf is a great place to just drop by check hours though indoor or outdoor seating is a available parking isn't bad either for a store front business without business parkingenjoy,positive
_mL3Bf0XwDLKvguY8vWr3w,i must say this place is interesting the name of the business describes it to the tee when i walked in it did appear to be a market which then transitioned into a buffet style layoutthere was a friendly man behind the counter to great me with a smile it was so hard for me to choose between all the yummy options i was satisfied with the price and the atmosphere it's definitely nothing fancy but it does have a nice cozy feel it's worth a tryparking is located in front of the market and is a bit snug,positive
L6vD-8zxZREX97GTHHWsZA,we have been eating here since moving to the area almost 12 years now and find the food to be consistently good for both lunch and dinner last thursday my daughter and i decided to go out for a late lunch close to 2 but after having some trouble locating a place that was still open and serving we finally decided to see if amarit was at all possible fortunately when we got to the restaurant at 149 they were extremely welcoming explaining to us that they serve lunch until 230 and not to worry because there were a couple of other tables who had just ordered or were finishing up their meals my daughter home from nyu got the chicken panang curry spiced medium while i chose the pork green curry spiced medium we also ordered two thai ice teas and as always everything was really tasty with each lunch entrée  comes soup and a spring roll and pricing  is more than reasonable at around 9 per dish i definitely agree with those who say that the service is great and that if you happen to be one of their regulars they will quickly learn your order including preference of spice level and what sort of ingredients you like or don't like in my case i'm not a fan of the bell peppers so instead they automatically confirm that once again i want to substitute it for the baby corn and they do it at no extra charge with regard to dinner we often dine in or bring home because the portion size is much larger even though the average price for an entrée is about 13 and does not include soup and spring roll like at lunchtime typically when we carry out we share the steamed dumplings for our appetizer and then split a single order of chicken pad woon sen or pork pad thai with plenty of food for each of us as for ambiance the restaurant is well appointed and feels homey there is also traditional music softly playing as you eat furthermore a sushi bar was recently added to the back dining area and the sushi rolls are super fresh and full of flavor we have tried other thai places in and around our neighborhood but hands down amarit is truly the best not surprisingly even on week nights the restaurant is quite busy and takeout orders are continuously being picked up,positive
Z4lwt5fK5-gINuWfI1aiRg,i had a great won ton soup and the chicken pad thai noodles with chicken and it was very reasonable and i did take out i think it was an outstanding experience and a great value and give it a very high reccomendation,positive
kZ1q0K13tFYG_ZJrVvsJHA,cool restaurant on a cool blockhole in the wall feel yet not so much  deceptive exterior by design at night  walked by several times before findingwow  yummy  all well done ming mule  quenching w lychee  bartender did not have to work hard for me to have another signature drinks  sake tasting flights  outstanding sake selections i always go small plates anywhere when offered though they have full on entree'spork bun baovietnamese chickenpork pot stickersplease sir can i have some moreall excellent  if you like this cuisine you'll love this place and should not be missed super friendly bar staffgreat concept  executed perfectly  tops in its genre  it deserves five stars in this space this my kind place in style form and function  i could hang here all night  but alas it's last call  beautifully lit  eclectic decoralmost makes me wish i lived in philly  pgreat music playlist just enough volume to be enjoyed and not impede conversationi am stingy with my stars  once in a while even i get lucky,positive
gjbmwlYUImb2lQBp5LV3KA,i have been here on multiple occasions each time there was a different menu every dish is exquisitely made to taste i really enjoyed the asian fusion the dishes had presentation of the food was amazingambience was very relaxing great place to have drinksservice is amazing our servers were great on all occasions really explained every dish to the t as they came outwill be here again definitely,positive
IcLm9Z1zphLnzUvrFK6aiA,part of my job entails processing expenses  week in and week out one of our hr generalist bob hands in reciepts from this place to expense  no joke he's there at a minimum about twice a week for business lunches  he took me last week and now i know why he's so obsessed with erawanduring your typical center city philly lunch rush most places are hard to find a table  this place must be the thai communities little secret because it was calm welcoming and we were seated right away  i try never to look at prices when ordering food because if you're going to treat yourself to anything in life food should be first on the list  however my boss was treating me and i didn't want to order anything too expensive  well that was near impossible since all of the prices are relatively close across the board and way way affordable  i think the lunch menu was around 795 or 895 per person and it wasn't just a single dish  i ordered red curry chicken and it came with this and it came with that and before i knew it i was eating a three course meal for lunch  everything was great and if i have one suggestion for tea lovers go with the ginger tea  it had a bit of a spice to it but it hit the spotin regards to decor it wasn't anything lavish but you can't judge a small place like this based on decor  in fact i found it to be relaxing  if it were a steven star restaurant that would be completely different and the bill would have been 5x's biggerso try this place out  if you're a thai fan i'm sure you'll like it and if not it won't burn a whole in your pocket  this is definitely one of my new little secret spots,positive
HCYs4zgL7kCLdEqKRqaPbg,fantastic food surprise tonight eating at lona's really nice spicy eggplant reminded me of some of my favorite travels totally delicious chicken tasty noodles awesome flavors the owner came and chatted with us for a while and shared some great stories i highly recommend a try,positive

HCYs4zgL7kCLdEqKRqaPbg,i have had you on my list of todos for the longest time you are out of my way so this was a much needed intentional trip lona is a natural asian fusion restaurant she is from a part of china that is the most ethically diverse so the blending of thai chinese and lao and other village ethic minorities makes this a beautiful place you will notice that there is no pork on the menu there is a small muslim minority from china called hui  and they are sometimes from the yunnan providence where lona is from so there is less pork in this part of china in general this is the deal this is not where you get your general gao's chicken although the asian amercian in me has a soft spot for that stuff this is where you can get fresh summer rolls with steak chicken tofus lots of vegetarianvegan options wo nuts and local beerpros1 get the steak and mushroom dumplings2 get a veggie sampler or any sampler3 always get the spicy eggplant as your side4 the fried brown rice is on point as well as the glass noodles5 the summer roll burrito wraps can be made with anything you choose your protein of steak chicken tofu and i got the special of the day that was brisket  with some salad medley 6 i love the ginger peanut sauce but it isn't as think as i would like it 7 they have a bar8 plenty of indoor and some outdoor seating9 very nice service for fast casualcons1 summer rolls appetizers were delicious but tiny 2 tea they need to be in a tea pot but it's in a cup it says tea pot on the menu you can ask for more water though to share with others 3 slightly on the pricer end for the type of food but the quality and atmosphere makes itfyi i do not recommend a doggie bag for your rice paper burrito because it can become hard very quickly in the fridge the next day if you have to take it home remember to keep it in a wet wrap towel  this place is fabulous i adore you lona i adore your story thank you,positive

Mgaxy0pJAlhAjdNivhu82A,best pad thai in town always a ton of food and pick your own spiciness 3 is my fav i need to try more here but always can't help but get the pad thai i hear the curry dishes are also incredible,positive
IkZgPqgwKSuQFAf4s0Z21g,oh yum like i've said before i judge a place by its ability to produce a good tom kha gai soup this place does it justice unbeknownst to me as i had used the facilities the bf had ordered and ordered a level 4 spice on the tom kha hell no i know better than that we were easily able to let the server and she subsequently informed the kitchen know that he was just crazy and that we wanted a level 3 spice on the tom kha when it came out it was perfect the shrimp rangoons were great better than the crab rangoon things i had at another thai place the pad thai was good but i can't be much of a judge on that since i don't care for the dish anyhow it looked pretty only real complain that i have is on the sake selection it was nonexistent the only thing they had was shochikubai snooze,positive
Rlxlbn8ZQbMs0lKt9kN0xw,i love this place so much and i'm pretty sure i go there often enough that they've started recognizing me their faces say we love you and your business but their eyes say you really need to get a lifecan't go wrong with the padd thai i feast on the massive portions for days afterwards a word of caution though don't go too spicy my first time here i went for spicyness level 4 because i'm hardcore but i swear i could spit hot fire whilst eating i enjoy my food on the spicier side and i can only handle level 3 so if you don't like spicy then go for a level 1 your butthole will thank you later overall my favorite thai place in indy,positive
2Yrf_aECZVHgTBVyw1r2kA,i decided to try this place because of the reviews on yelp i dined here on a sunday afternoon around 1230 the dinning area was little over 13 full and there was only a hostess  a sever working i ordered the chicken pad thai boring to some but i enjoy it the food took a little while to get out nearly 45 minutes to get two orders of pad thai chicken out overall i enjoyed the chicken pad thai i am aware some put tofu in but they seem to really pile it in i would've liked a little more chicken  a little less tofu my boyfriend got the thai tea and he said he enjoyed it sweet  flavorful,positive
l_mx_q740TLKBPCMa_mtJw,thai spice is my absolute favorite thai place in indy but i've only ever been for lunch their lunch is so reasonable and amazingly delicious the decor is simple and beautiful and every time i've gone it's been packed expect to maybe wait and to park in the adjoining lotfirst of all order the thai iced tea if you've had it before you know how amazing it is so next you pick a lunch entree i usually go with pad seuw or pad thai they will bring you a cup of their lemongrass soup and a fried springroll  the springroll is nothing too special but that soup is my favorite my golden standard i've had it other places and nothing compares i would seriously eat it everyday if i could it's perfectly spicy with fresh veggies and the most delightful lemongrass flavor now the entrees are pretty huge i'm pretty good at finishing lunch mains but i can never get through a whole plate thereservice is always very fast here as well fingers crossed i'm in greenwood again soon or i might have to make an excuse to go,positive

_V3YkIkqAn4V6U-cAykVtw,went here on a whim with a group of 7 had a pretty short wait for a friday night i ordered an age dashi tofu appetizer that was pretty good and for dinner chose the pad thai with tofu and no egg that meal is delicious and i highly recommend pad thai danknessthe service could improve not sure what happened but we had a server swap that threw me off a little they also brought out the sushi on a huge plate nice display,positive
ivD5l1I3a146ZDGIfr6HYA,really tasty food delicious satay appetizer and peanut sauce portions a decent size nice selection of food and beer good service my only complaint it gets pricey because everything is a la carte ordered 3 on the hotness scale which is not for the faint of heart but wasn't hot enough for my hubby definitely worth a visit but will come at lunch to keep cost down a bit,positive
iC12uB5WlrarJg55hVqieg,absolutely 5 starsfrom the food to the service to the decor this place is fabulous the portions are dinner sized at lunch our sever was kind and just simply gracious cant wait to go back again,positive

vjRzu0bzp8wf6pDYFqt4qA,my husband was convinced he wouldn't like thai food but after dragging him in this is one of his favorites we mostly enjoy the fried rice and the crab rangoon appetizer is a must price is much better when you go for lunch especially considering what you get with the lunch portions however no crab rangoon offered at lunch  ,positive
WYVfBAH5GMWp2REVIAt30w,star sushi has a great selection of rolls at decent prices we had the edamame crab rangoon salad and miso soup as our appetizers for the main course we had the california volcano and holiday rolls the food was fantastic and so was the friendly service i will definitely come back in the future,positive
oA1NDj8Sv9uz0eyJrUdu6g,never been disappointed just wish that their place was bigger so they could accommodate more customers because of how busy they usually are we have only had take out from vic and at times the wait is a bit long however still highly recommend  there is a wait for a reason ,positive
o6No8FiwyDAOlcY7PGUEXw,so glad i got in here on opening day i live close by and had been passing the storefront for weeks so i've been eager to try it outwe walked in on a thursday night and had no wait  which was awesome the two women on staff were extremely friendly and helpful with our questions we ordered drinks margaritas in a thai restaurant ok yes and crab rangoon to start  and it was fabulous the dish was served with a really great dipping sauce as well not a traditional sweet  sour when we ordered entrees we were asked to specify how spicy we wanted our meals  so be prepared for that there are lots of options for vegetarians seafood lovers and meat eaters which is great we skipped on dessert this round because we were full but there was sweet sticky rice that i would love to try at some pointthey appeared to have food options at lots of different price points so it looks pretty budgetfriendly and on mass ave that's always a win in my book last note beer lovers the beer selection here is small get a cocktail or wine insteadlooking forward to visiting this place more often,positive
jz41zeEyGVEBhE2LiROICQ,i am happy to share my experience at this place i really love their seafood during my tampa vacation i must say you can visit this restaurant atleast once to enjoy thai food,positive
-1B9pP_CrRBJYPICE5WbRA,the first thing about this place is the ambiance they have a really good dim lighting making this a great date spot the food is primarily fusion and they do a good job of making all of their dishes tasty i got their noodles and was not disappointed it was flavorful plentiful and affordable especially with the 10 offer on yelp,positive
fD3IuxoCXY1B-cpMDcqmCw,we stopped in for lunch and they are open for dinein although we ate outside at one of their picnic benches they have lunch specials i had the red curry which was delicious and it came with two crab rangoon and a small soup that was also very yummy my partner had the beef and broccoli which they enjoyed as well they both came out piping hot so be warned we will definitely be back,positive
AyMsrYiHSkgDT9noSc-E4Q,as an avid yelper i did my research before settling on this little gem when looking for my new goto thai place and i was absolutely rewarded for my efforts what this place lacks in decor and ambiance it completely makes up for with great quality we were pleasantly surprised by our free mini salad cups and were so in love with how the delicious peanut satay sauce changed otherwise cold boring iceburg mix into a truly awesome preappetizernever thought i'd be sad when i ran out of lettucewe ordered the chicken satay springrolls and tom kha soup as appetizers and they were so good the soup in particular was excellenti had a bit of a cold and the hot creamy limey spicy broth was basically a god sendfor dinner we both got the panang chicken curry which was supremely tasty but not as spicy as we were hopingi got a level four and my date got a level five so as people who love spicy food we were hoping to really feel the burn as i said it was exactly what we wanted from panang it just didn't quite hit the level of heat we wantednext time we'll be really emphatic about our spice levels the only thing that was missing was the thai tea i love it but as we went later in the evening they had understandably run out oh well just another reason to go back ,positive
DbARcEuX6NvWN_hSQKHMJg,this is about 5 years overdue this is an excellent holeinthewall thai food  although its fast becoming a tampa area favorite everyone seems to know about it food is cheap you sit outside in front of a river nice view excellent thai food made by thai people,positive

EOobui95wyxhAofw6f7ETA,best thai food i've had in reno in a long time better than bangkok cuisine don't be scared by the fact that it's weirdly located in a strip mall right next to a gas station i really hope this place makes it,positive
ivD5l1I3a146ZDGIfr6HYA,surprisingly authentic tasting thai food don't get above spice level 3 unless you like to sweat really liked the eggplant and basil with chicken and the papaya salad staff was great too,positive
rpFT0AX5kqMdtbdNH-gvdA,i was visiting a friend in florida and on her birthday we came to nitally's to celebrate i had never heard of thaimex fusion but it was one of the best experiences i've had we had made reservations ahead of time so there was no waitthe nachos were pretty good nothing too special and it could feed a small village so be prepared to bring your stretchy pants i ordered the penang mole with shrimp which was absolutely truly delicious a one of a kind dish i can't remember the spicyness levels but i believe i got one level below thai spicy because apparently thai spicy is death i thought my level was perfect for the dish but others who ordered their dishes mild were dying with that level so choose wisely four of us also split the sangria  sweet and tasty but it had a lot of ice in it overall this place was great service was a tad slow but we were a big group and they were pretty busy it was a great place to enjoy a nice birthday celebration with friends and awesome food,positive
0G25IDvgvoqASYsqu0HbCw,i feel like i've been let in on a little secret in this quaint and decorative thai restaurant it's actually a rather comforting setting and even on a friday it wasn't very crowded the waitstaff did their job perfectly and the food was darn good i have no complaints and will definitely be back to try my thai staples i tried the amazing eggplant of course as that over the top review prompted me to if you're looking for tasty thai head over here,positive
jL3R9dm_1sLRCAdINzpJDw,the nicest people work here i love thai food and this place is truly authentic fresh and delicious we call in for takeout very oftenlike weekly my menu favorites avocado red curry  soy sauce noodle,positive

7etaSB4-9MPhShMsdLWINg,food was great but the water i think may have been sitting for awhile before they brought it to us one glass had a few ice cubes and the other glass was pretty much melted completely but the food def made up for it,positive

IkZgPqgwKSuQFAf4s0Z21g,how is it that we have so many good thai places in town  well i can now add another to that list of good placesi was having dinner with a buddy to catch up  we had originally planned on sushibut i just wasn't feeling it so i switched to a place i had never been  sawasdee our funds were a little tighter than usual so we split the green papaya salad and then ordered up two entrees  i ordered the green curry and he ordered the pad thai with chicken  all were ordered two stars for spicy and came out appropriately  some heat but not anything strong at allthe service was just fine  no complaints  surprising since i think there was only one person in the front of the house taking care of at least 7 tablesone thing i didn't like was that the menu didn't match the rest of the experience  it was just a black and white photocopy slipped into a sheet protector of some sort  this cheap detail didn't match the meal nor did it match the decor of the restaurant  i guarantee that we will return because my wife loves thai food way more than i do and she needs to try this place out,positive
eAo14BpElFloDZfZhUlNTg,sukhothai or sukho thai restaurant can be found along n dale mabry highway just south of waters avenue the restaurant not to be confused with the vietnamese restaurant next door is directly across the street from walmart and in the same little strip mall as a pawn shop the name sukhothai means dawn of happinessour wonderful yelp community intern and worldrenowned foodie blogger carlos h recommended this place and i was glad to give it a try this is a very nice quiet asian restaurant which offers sitting at traditional tables stools at the sushi bar or in a private room where you slip off your shoes and sit on pillows on the floor and then eat from a low tablethe cuisine is a tasty mixture of sushi and traditional thai food as a result you'll be enjoying food that is spicy sour and highlighted with citrus lime and lemongrass traditional ingredients include curries coconut milk hot peppers rice noodles and crushed peanuts along with various veggies meats and seafoodi started with a bowl of thom yum soup with shrimp in case you're not familiar thom yum is one of the most popular soups in thailand and wellknown for its many health benefits the soup is made with chicken broth minced lemongrass kaffir lime leaves a variety of chilies mushrooms onions and all kinds of spices and herbs to that they added a few shrimp which gave me a very delicious spicy and sour soup i ordered mine medium but you can request thai hot if your sinuses can handle the heatalong with the soup i tried two different sushi rolls the first was a spicy duck roll made with tempura duck cucumber cilantro and a spicy soy sauce i also had their monster roll which was made with yellowtail and octopus mixed with spicy mayo masago and spinach and then topped with tempura flakes both sushi rolls were delicious but i especially liked the spicy ducki've tried thai food at several restaurants around town and enjoy the mix of flavors i would like to return to sukhothai at some point and try some of the more traditional thai entrees such as the crispy boneless duck massaman chicken sliced chicken cooked in curry sauce with peanuts and coconut milk and shrimp  scallops cooked in a green curry basil sauceif you haven't tried thai food then i encourage you to visit a good thai restaurant in your neighborhood and get to know the cuisine,positive
wQUBiBqlzC6cbdkX-GaBqQ,forever love thai food thai lotus is nice and quaint i loved all of the authentic decor it reminded me of home my friend and i got sat and the service was pretty good and attentive i ordered my usual rad na it was made a bit different than what i'm used to way more vegetables and less noodles which made me sad bc noodles are the best part however flavor wise this rad na was not bad at all it's not my favorite that i've ever had but i wouldn't mind visiting this place again,positive
bp482wqF6v80AltDNlPDfw,eggplant sandwich fried rice and cindy love them all farmers market fresh and homemade foodies will love it here,positive
MbF4rS7fDXmqxKP2Hj0Pug,the best thai dining in the meadows si and mi are warm and friendly making the experience more enjoyable,positive
EVqumzu_CSGws7XMTCl5og,beware they are running a promotion for reviewers to give them high marks take those recent 4 and 5star reviews with that in mind i have had decent ok experiences at this place before but recently went for lunch and it was just a bad experiencehorrible service took 45 minutes to get pad thai and then it just tasted bad somehow thai medium  no spice  very sweet,negative
NXbsRaSCuPKbcCuTVHA57g,since i live in the neighborhood i decided to give this restaurant a try with my friend  we arrived at 8pm on a thursday and while we expected to wait a bit for a table we didn't expect to stand at the door for over 5 minutes completely ignored the dining room was full but it's only about 15 tables so not sure what that was all about  we finally sat down with menus and waited another 10 minutes before we were greeted by a server  i had to ask one of the servers passing by for service  not a good sign  it also wasn't a good sign that other patrons were anxiously looking around for their server to come to their tables  so we ordered the pad thai w chicken and a shrimp and bamboo stir fry  we specified spicy and we received the opposite  the food was generally bland  the chicken was obviously overcooked tough and rubbery  we received a side order of rice which seemed like it was previously cooked and then reheated it was a bit hardenedthis is a byob but their nonalcoholic drink choices are minimal so bring something  anything to drink with youi am a huge fan of thai cuisine maybe i am spoiled since i've had the pleasure of experiencing the real thing in thailand but this was absolutely subpar i'm really disappointed and wish that it was betteri will not be going back,negative
-b7A7e2zh3CDTpgChRoRKw,went here first and last time  the food must have been sitting pre made for a while it came out so fast i think they scoop the ingredients that r sitting then mixed together with what ever sauce mix or flavor you order the noodles where mush and the sauce was too sweet without any flavor the meat in the 2nd dish was shriveled and dry  the decor was nice,negative
jJSgDuY9sLzUfZ91_YSCog,just a little disappointed as i was waiting so long for the restaurant to open i went to the thai esane in the past location multiple times for lunch and dinner because their chicken pad thai was the best the price was reasonable service was great and location was on point but after the move the price was disappointing even though i was expecting a raise in price and the chicken pad thai was okay i don't think i'll go going again to the new location,negative
QU8DcR2JhR06mIAOvJsJVw,stay away from this restauranteverything we ordered tonight tasted really stale and way too salty we couldn't eat any of it  really too bad because my family went hungry tonight attached is a stale green curry,negative
EVqumzu_CSGws7XMTCl5og,i ordered the chicken satay green curry with chicken and indian puff bread the first thing i noticed was that i paid more for the food and received less of the food than i would back at home i suppose it's because i come from an area where thai food is pretty common whereas it's not as common here as for the actual food the indian puff bread was pretty good different from home but not in a bad way i was dunking it into the green curry sauce but the sauce was so thin it didn't sop up enough for my liking it also didn't help that the puff bread itself didn't seem conducive to sopping up sauce the green curry with chicken was decent i ordered the mild but it was a little spicier than what i would expect for mild curry and while it wasn't bad it just wasn't good at home i order curry and i get excited about eating it this one i stuck the leftovers in the fridge and ended up not really wanting to eat it afterward  i know people like the thai food here because they make it spicy like it's supposed to be but if you ask me my food managed to be spicy without being flavorful i could feel the heat it just wasn't tasty the chicken satay didn't really seem like the chicken satay i'm used to eating the peanut sauce was delicious and the chicken itself was well cooked but they put some sort of sweetsour sauce on it as well and the coconut milk sauce that's supposed to be on satay didn't seem to be on there i honestly wanted to like this place but i don't think i'd eat here again by choice call me a thai food snob if you must but this just isn't the thai food place for me i know there are a lot of people who enjoy it and i'm glad that they do but i am definitely not a fan of this place price wouldn't matter so much to me if the food was worth it but it's not in my opinion,negative
_VGl0isVwzRJpMMwljoWIQ,ordered takeout green curry was a weird green like lime green the color freaked me out because it was so artificial looking i asked them to add bamboo shoots i spit out my first bite the bamboo shoots tasted like they'd been sitting in chemicals i tried another bite and it was worse than before i ended up throwing out the whole meal waste of money i love thai food and eat it from various places in tampa and throughout the us frequently but this was truly some of the worst i've ever had will not be returning giving 2 stars because the veggie spring rolls were tolerable,negative
S3W5FolQsYjvwWTkc5yWxw,it was ok but super pricey for what you got i think the pad thai was like 16 or even more usually you can get a fantastic pad thai for closer to 13ambiance was sort of like a pub and the service wasn't the greatest i prefer bangkok cuisine for thai in reno,negative
8Pw3gUxSISkGqWNOsdWQ4Q,everything that came to the table was greasy and lackluster my food was bland and the rice was hard i hate to be so rough but the food here was not very good food 25service 35location 35,negative
gfIj5FvIejEiex4WV04wIQ,food was just terrible not even close to thai spend your monies else where folks1,negative
Z9kSxZ24MQ_8IBXb2epknw,i am so bummed about this review because i only try and leave positive reviews  first this place is usually good but we ordered online and i requested thai hot and then in the requests said extra spicy  to my surprise it had zero spice  when i called all the lady said was sorry and she would let the kitchen know that does nothing to rectify the lack of spice my suggestion is either order in person or eat there this was basic and boring,negative
S1Oatik7asDJdXbcVL3vRg,very disappointing it was our first time here and it will be our last it was just two of us and she told us that it would be a half hour for hibachi on a sunday night when there was no wait for any other table there was only one hibachi chef working however there was room at a table that just sat it just seemed odd that they would let us wait or leave rather than serve us we left,negative
O9-YRALwLemgW4qXLl7RLw,horrible experiences we were the only guest there and waited 44 mins for the food to arrive  went to ask for a straw the lady told me to get it myself  poor service never coming back again,negative
tYAHogxI44JV3U6lyuT58Q,ordered takeout  it was ready when we arrived padthai was seasoned noodles with some pieces of chicken on top fresh roll was mostly lettuce will go elsewhere for thai cravings,negative
rTXNiH-RROF1OQHVIn5qJQ,this use to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat but lately they have had terrible service the food is good but the service is so bad that i rather go else where i never know who my server is because they switch out so often and the few times i been helped it's after we are done with all of our food and have been waiting like 20 minutes for the check i hope they see this review and start training their staff a little better if they were able to train their staff better then i would love to go back,negative
kaKqai4yyt2qLt6XRv9Hyw,asked for something take out with no stars because i don't do spicy i was told when i got there that it was mild but it's so hot i literally can't eat it i'm not a wimp my husband who orders food with three stars said it was too hot for him very disappointing,negative
96r6iyqbZo8OjJGAWbDgQw,i only ordered sushi through uber eats and some sweet and sour soup the spicy tuna roll was but one get one which was foolish in hindsight definitely not fresh the salmon though seems okay i ordered the sweet and sour soup medium spice but my mouth is on fire also they thickened it slightly and i'm not a huge fan maybe their thai is good but skip the sushi and order less spicy than you might normally,negative
qAyZXMjWo5mW21Ql53iThA,not a good first experience walked in and got seated within 5 minutes but then no one came to our table for over ten minutes no water no we're busy right now no acknowledgement that we were even there we were definitely anxious since we heard the food was good but nervous because we read on yelp that the service was terrible we learned for ourselves that the service is terrible we decided to walk out and go somewhere else if you don't have enough staff to wait and serve then you shouldn't open your restaurant till you do maybe in the future we will order out or not,negative
gh81r-SZodvcty5QDaLyhg,we were absolutely exhausted after a 14 hour flight so ordered delivery to the philadelphia international airport marriott hotel delivery was within the 3045 minute window we were told however i am so saddened to report that this was the worst pad thai i have ever eaten it couldn't even be called that really it was simply noodles with some orange sauce  i have no idea what it was i ordered medium spicy and it was incredibly bland i couldn't taste the fish sauce couldn't taste the characteristic tanginess of the dish elsewhere what did they use an unsolved mystery its tofu however was surprisingly good mom's pineapple fried rice on the other hand was pretty good i've had much better but at least we could both eat that as a decent dinnerportions were big so one dish can feed 2 adults with average appetites almost 40 for those 2 dishes and 2 cokes on uber eats all in all an average restaurant that doesn't seem to do thai right can't recommend unfortunately,negative
8syjAtrpRfBgiH2vcfNsrg,the first time i dined here was after the hurricane they did not have power and cooked a limited menu by generator the guests dined outside which was rather fun the service was excellent i left a 10 cash tip on a 13 tab and looked forward to going back this evening i went back i wanted a dish not made with fish or oyster sauce after being tag teamed by 2 servers who were back and forth asking questions to the cook about the sauce i asked 1 of the servers who would be waiting on me she said she would in addition to the dish i ordered a soda and egg rolls the dish came twice i mentioned it to have medium spice dish was not spicy at all and i never received the soda or egg rolls i observed the server who took my order and noted she was not so busy as to forget and not get my order correct good servers do not need to be reminded of an order needless to say i will not return my favorite place is thai coconut in largo i will continue going there,negative
L6vD-8zxZREX97GTHHWsZA,it's okay i've tasted much better drunken noodles and i find theirs to be a little dry the meat isn't tender in the noodlesbut if you just have to have thai and there is no other place around then this would do it's just okay,negative
eaDZlSuVS0EY67Ke6pRP6Q,my sister and i were ignored twice when we were waiting to be seated the server a brunette totally overlooked us and sit others behind us firstmaybe because they were white and we are asian maybe there's some interalized racism at play in here we were quite upset by that the food itself was mediocre and not filling enough,negative
YwrL69clJBmO9-HgA7dfUA,done carry out a few times before but tried to call on the way so it would be ready when we got there and there was no answer called over 20 times and it just rang forever each time so safe to say carry out isn't a thing anymore,negative
PU0k0ylp9ZIjTAadluXXdg,hate to leave a one star review but it is deserved i ordered delivery through postmates and got pad thai and green curry i wish i would have taken a picture of the full meal but only took a picture of the green curry to show a friend how sad the portion size was the pad thai was extremely dry with little flavor and little spice the chicken in it was also very dry my boyfriend didn't even finish his meal and that is a rare occurrence the side salad with my curry which was very unexpected was the best part of my meal only because of the dressing there was a also a disproportionately large serving of rice with the small curry while the meal was cheap i am still upset that i spent money on such a small and vegetabledepleted half cup of curryon the bright side i didn't overeat as i usually do while going to thai places and that's not just because of the wimpy portion size of my meal lemongrass thai is my usual goto and i will absolutely drive the extra 15 minutes next time around for a reliably good meal,negative
IAOJuLejVtnZJpw15Txu9A,the first time i came here my order took 45 minutes for lunch that is unacceptable the second time i order my food ahead of time it was scheduled to be done in 2530 minutes i arrived 45 minutes after ordering and my food had not even been started yet the food is good but i simply cannot justify going back,negative
tYAHogxI44JV3U6lyuT58Q,i dont get the opportunity very often to eat anything other than normal american so i was excited when my wife said that she was willing to try thiait was a toss up between the newer thai basil and this place i decided on this place because they looked they had a more authentic thai based menuthai basil's menu is more of a cross between thai and chinese in all my years in boise and meridian i have never been to sawaddeethe old saying is that you never get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression this saying stands as true just as much for restaurants as for peoplestanding outside of sawaddee getting ready to go in i had my initial impression it was of a run down restaurant that had not curb appeal whatso ever it suspect that it looked like it looked many years ago when it 1st opened up it could be any business just a drab store front type location on the outside then my wife and i walked inside the inside is small but not that bad after all sometimes good things do come in small packages so i kept an open mindthe waitress sat as at a very small table there were just 2 of us but this table barely had room for us both i was not impressed it made me feel claustrophobic like if i leaned just a bit too far to the left i would fall offmy wife and i watch a lot of restaurant impossible the show with robert irvine in which he tries to fix failing restaurants restaurants that are failing due to neglect and bad foodso when we walked into sawaddee the 1st thing we did is looked around when a restaurant has a dirty and unkempt dining room its always a sure sign that the kitchen is dirty and unkempt as wellthis is of course only logical why would a restaurant keep their kitchen clean if they cant do this in their dining room and vice versathe answer is that they dont if any restaurant has a dirty dining room you can just about guarantee that the kitchen is no differentwhen we looked at the dining room of sawaddee we saw ceiling tiles that were dirty and had those nasty looking drop down ceilings the ones that usually conceal lots and lots more dirt along with dead rats and other such nastiness once the ceiling tile is lifted uponce my wife and i saw thins we lost our appetite but we ordered anyway i had the swd fried chicken on a side note what in the world does swd meanthe chicken tasted like it either had been frozen or cooked much much earlier it was a dish that was similar to sweet and sour chicken minus the sour so the chicken dish was nothing but sweet and not a good sweet eithermy wife had the yakosoba it did not look appetizing at all so neither my wife or i could bring ourselves to try itthe only real nice things i have to add to this review was our server the menu and the box they used for the checkour server was very nice and they all looked asian i hate eating at asian restaurants where all the staff is whitespeaking of the serve staff there were a lot of them there were only 3 or 4 tables that were full of people eating so i have no idea why there were so many staff they all just stood up at the front behind the counter like a police line upthe menu had a wood cover with a large image oh a hindu god as a christian i was not pleased to be presented with this but it did make the menu look like what id expect in a thai restaurantwhen we were done with our meal or lack thereof we were presented with a box with our ticket like a cigar box but not as thick the box also had this hindu gods image on itafter this experience i doubt that my wife will let me take her to another adventurous  place this was an adventure but not a good onewe were happy to leave this place and will not be back,negative

A0zZI5AnaeK4-vKoc9ABmg,i had some time to waste before a class so i decided to stop at arroy thai i walked in and saw that the interior is very nice all dark wood tables and chairs i ordered the springrolls as an appetizer and the curry chicken fried rice as an entree the spring rolls came out almost immediately i said wow that was fast the waitress said well they are premade the sweet chili peanut sauce was good but i think it may have been out of a jar it tasted like the sauce we have at work the spring rolls were large and i got 4 of them for 5 i would have liked it better to get 2 and had shrimp in them i barely ate one roll and here came my entree at this point i am mildly perturbed the curry fried rice was good also but everything tasted premadeas if you order and then they take a cup of this and a smidge of that i spent 24 on one meal i want it made fresh from start to end the tea was ok but had an they need to clean the nozzles taste to it i expected more and got disappointed a bit i don't know if i'd go back they are pricey for premade food the service was just ok but there were only 3 people dining that night several people came saw and left,negative

ES8YqqXVu2TO6o2iwAOYSQ,i only wish i could give a 1 starthis place is just so rude and has horrible customer service i also ordered online to find out they don't deliver after i placed my order then manager was so awful that they actually yelled at me and blamed me for the mistake even thought it clearly says the deliver online i had such a bed experience trying to order food that they left me in tearsbuyer be ware and stay away unless you feel like getting yelled at for their mistake,negative
qTicP3qlsW6zqLV7P1Uz_g,the food was subpar and crowded  customer service was nonexistent  took a long time for our food to arrive  they don't take reservations and they don't write down your name so how will they know who is next,negative
MbF4rS7fDXmqxKP2Hj0Pug,both my wife and i ordered meals without fish sauce and tofu instead of meat we got our food to go and when we got home there was shredded chicken under the tofu and noodles in both of our meals we won't be back,negative
fuiVa2_MABIQS7pINKcoLw,what a bummer siam square was a fountain square staple before the revamp the interior is great but the new ordering style and staff not so great my coworker and i waited over 20 minutes for our food we finally said something when we noticed people after us we're getting the same dishes we were but ordered after us i went up to a staff member to ask what was going on and after giving me a bullshit excuse another person came to our table to say the ticket machine stopped working hard to believe since we got our salads which were on the same ticket they could've handled this situation a thousand times better but instead we're kind of jerks about it i had to ask to be reimbursed since we had been waiting over 40 minutes now our other coworker had finished their food we loved siam square but unfortunately we'll never go back,negative
Cj115fn0LsfcNLlYseKxSA,nasty little asian lady gave me a dirty look when we walked in and sighed and rolled her eyes when my wife asked for another minute before we placed our order we got up and left,negative
PU0k0ylp9ZIjTAadluXXdg,not bad for a fastfood style thai place everything is disposable including the styrofoam cups service was very good food was decent,negative
hOCBl_QltuMzYOcb2juGoQ,the sushi was all mixed together which is problematic for me as i am pregnant and can't eat raw fish so i purposely ordered a roll without raw fish secondly my entree the chicken wasn't fully cooked and the rice was very soggy that it was inedible,negative
hM611cPF2RlyqDHq7NACog,i don't recommend this place  this is my third time coming here over two years  meal size is tiny and overpriced at least for the portion of food that you get i'd give only one star but the decor inside looked nice the outside looks bad though ate dinner here around 545 pm and it was almost empty  the older lady asked me if i was there to pick up an order and i was like no are you open i'd like to eat here  didn't seem friendly  i ordered the pad thai with beef and was disappointed  the size of the meal 1295 was so very small it was served on a square plate and the size of the dinner meal was that of a small saucer plate  although it tasted good i do not recommend eating here if you want to be almost the only one in the restaraunt or if you have a normal appetite  now i'll have to go somewhere else to get something to eat to satisfy my hunger  i surely wasn't going to order more at this place seeing how small their serving size is,negative
BfkqPDZ2Tt7Afhp5gn3wfw,my husband and i wanted some thai takeout so we decided to get thai mint we've dined in before and the food was fine enough to satisfy a thai food craving we called a few times to place an order but got a busy signal after reading several reviews that said they don't answer the phone we just decided to go there and place a takeout order and wait for it we drove the twenty minutes from our house and once we got there and told them we wanted to place a takeout order we were turned away they said they are too busy and wouldn't do it there were definitely empty tables and no people waiting to be seated the woman was very rude and not apologetic at all the other thing to note is they when she approached us she grabbed menus assuming we were dining in so they weren't too busy to feed us there but were for takeout needless to say we will never be back they are terrible people who obviously don't care about customer service,negative
IbM-7UstAX8HVQ5vKCrLzA,turned me down 15 min before the closing time 844pm saying we are closing in 15 min so we are doing carryout only  no regrets just plain message in front of two other female employees i don't know if it's legal in indiana to turn down customers before the advertised closing time wanted to post this before the closing time also there was no customer in the restaurant also i walked in a nice weather voluntarily for 22 min to reach before 9pm now i have find something walkable if it's not closing at 9pm what a bummer,negative
kZ1q0K13tFYG_ZJrVvsJHA,it pains me to give sampan 2 stars i've eaten here a plethora of times and keep coming back because the food is consistently delicious and i've never had a problem with service tonight was the worst service i've ever had here in no less than 10 visits firstly the table seated next to us who sat down after us got all of their courses before our edamame dumplings  the first course of the chef's tasting menusecondly our waiter checked on us far less than the number of times he checked on other tables around us he barely conversed with us which usually i wouldn't care about but i heard him ask our neighboring table where they were from and other questions lastly we had to request fresh plates and water from other servers as ours was missing my friend ordered hot tea which he brought fairly quickly and walked away but then she had to request a spoon  again from a different server,negative
w0g9q4BC-OFdByt-AYePNQ,every time i go here i tell myself its the last time on this past action i ordered for pick up they put curry in a  three holding containers resulting in a huge mess at the bottom of the bag we also revived a bag of eggrolls without asking all three dishes i ordered i asked for no meat and the egg rolls were stuffed with beef the curry was less than a cup and seemed like it was missing half maybe because it was at the bottom of my bag the time before that i went alone to grab an avocado roll they set me behind a pole and forgot i was there it took 20 minuets to order and another 20 just to get white rice on norri sheet with an slice of avocado  times before that i asked to sit in the back with a my friend they said no it wasn't reserved and i have been seated there before my visit today will be my last,negative
-p1n0tJURpNW5vwM0dGBcw,i went with my friend for lunch and ordered the pud thai comes with spring roll soup and rum cake  i took one spoonful of the soup and was like whoa that is horrible it was super salty the waitress brought us salads to replace the soup which tasted a lot better  i had a couple bites of my pad thai and just couldn't eat anymore the flavor was not like any pad thai i have had before i brought home my leftovers to my husband   i love thai food but something was off with the flavor,negative
bPVPZeqMuYtU_yGCb4P-jg,i don't understand how  why this place gets the reviews it does i don't get it to start nothing about this place can be classified as authentic thai cuisine since every single dish has an american twist to it that's not to say that fusion food doesn't top my list but this place does neither thai or fusion well to preface i've tried most things on the menu to rule out ordering a one off dish every dish i've tried has a distinct empty bowl off flavor to it too salty or too sweet or too dry or just too bland  people fall in love with thai food for the rich balanced flavors of sweet sour and spicy etc this place tries way too hard but fails when it comes to capturing any of the right flavors overpriced and overhyped save yourself the disappointment and check out any other thai restaurant in town,negative
S1Oatik7asDJdXbcVL3vRg,our meal at jasmine was likely the worst asian restaurant meal ever  the management was even worse  the managers were screaming at the employees the whole hour we were there  we were offered no comps and left the dinner on the table,negative
g33s03KL3BTPgTPg_6r_Kw,i went once and didn't like it but since so many people do like it i thought i would give it another try  perhaps i just hit it on an off night that first timei went againand i still don't like itwhat is with all the good reviewsdo people think a place is better and more authentic just because it's gritty and off the beaten paththe food is mediocre at best and the service could not possibly have been worse  oh i take that back i didn't get any service   it was the first time in my life that i left less than 20 tip but i couldn't bring myself to leaving a decent tip for nonexistent servicei'll never go back,negative
K_9S5UXwzBlZR2Ux_RK9dA,i've seen this place a few times and decided to go with a couple of friends to try something new  although the place is very nice we were the only ones in there  the first thing that struck us was the menu prices  they were a bit higher than what we were used to from other places in the area  i ordered the curry puffs first and they were ok  since i had never had them before i wasn't sure what to expect  when they came out they were fried and pretty crunchy with a lot of dough and not much stuffing   we finally ordered dinner and when it came out we were all a little shocked at the portionssmall  we had thought earlier that since the prices were a bit higher maybe the portions would make up for it but no  the food came out hot and was ok but nothing special  we decided we had all had better so we won't be going back,negative
vvGrGn6eo-K_W5h96Pyslw,meh  expecting more from past reviewsbarely passable food service was cold and strange place was almost empty but felt rushed to leave 6pm absolutely no compelling reason to return,negative
fuiVa2_MABIQS7pINKcoLw,wow the worst service i have ever received from a restaurant in my life they got the order wrong and then expected me to pay extra for their mistake and harassed me they will never have my service again,negative
AODksDNj5mH953cyhUG1Qw,you can blame me and my lack of culture or whatever it is you are trying to pin on me but the fact remains your food sucks and you try to blame the customer for it get a clue you are the worst thai restaurant in tampa,negative
TMQT3p3jSFOs4-yzUHWBAQ,limited menu you couldn't find the basics such as pad seeew the food is bland and just not that good wont go back also the reviews are very deceiving  and looks like the business paid people to leave such high reviews,negative
g8ZqVCalVp-PsOqyS4dXGw,i gave the rt 202 location a try  based on a suggestion from a friend and i am guessing i won't return  the service was attentive but the food was a weak representation of thai cuisine  the tom yung koong tasted like mama noodle base and they had italian basil in there with a ton of sugar the jungle beef salad was also too sweet and the toasted rice powder  that was sprinkled over the salad was under toasted to the point that it ended up as sharp flavorless pebbles in your mouth  portions are decent and byob  but the cooking at this location leaves much to be desired and i would rarely be that critical about a restaurant even when considering that most american thai restaurants are cooking in the bangkok style but tailored to farang taste,negative
XvH1dU72eD-G8nPHKv6TDA,i was so excited to see a thai restaurant opening so close to home i tried to call and place an order ahead of time but no one answered so i went there to just order and wait i walk in people were seated at tables some eating some not no one greeted me at the front i went to the back to order and there were three very young girls in the front and three older wines in the back no one addressed me at all until i asked if i could order here then i was told i needed to wait to order as they were currently working on about 10 to go orders on the counter finally about 10 minutes in another couple came in to order take out at that point one of the girls said that it would be a long wait if they wanted to order take out now and asked who was there first i had only been standing in front of her for 10 minutes but ok after it was established that my food would take an inordin amount of time i left and went to tuk tuk thai i do want to give this place a chance and maybe not on a friday night just be aware that they are new and are still working out the kinks not sure how the food is as i couldn't get any tonight,negative
uMVOtr16r1ELu46pWr4HCQ,despite some of the good reviews i thnk this place is ok i just flew in from vegas to visit my sister and i wanted some thai food to eat she recommended this place i ordered the beef pad see eew and the papaya salad the pad see eew noodles tasted old vegetables were too wilted and overall too sweet papaya salad it was okay it came with pieces of beef on the side the taste and tuffness reminded meow jack daniels beef sticks would i come back here no,negative
K_BoVdQ-FUsNGvxXwHz7Aw,food was bland and made the bf  i sick the next day 1 extra star for prompt  free delivery,negative
22C6ueBbwUM7hpLU-sTExw,easily the worst food i have had in 2019 not one thing i was served was fresh everything is frozen and reheated but its ok if it wherent for the freezer burn i would not have tasted anything everything served to me was extremely bland all of the food was over cooked and dry really the bar was pretty low when i walked in here i hadnt eaten in 2days i wasnt in a hard to impress mood but the sandwich from the doller store i had eaten 3 days before annihilates the food i was served here in every way the next time someone makes me wait 25miniuts for a check after serving me such shit im walking out at the 15min mark if you havent taken my money at that point thats your problem i have a hard time paying you for such crap to begin with 0stars for service 1 stars for food this place was highly recommended to me by multiple parties after this experience i will never eat here again i have a microwave in my kitchen too,negative
uVJkqQ1U9MH7hBorrwGhBg,i'm sure someone likes it but not me i spent 13 on a dinner and didn't even finish it  that's saying something because i love food i love eating and i don't like wasting food they seem to be trying too hard to have unique recipes i did not enjoy their tough fried chicken and the mac and cheese was just disgusting also i was put off by the fact that rap music was playing so loud that you couldn't have a conversation about their somewhat confusing ordering system,negative
vUkiYPpbkMXA99WneLSGkQ,i wish i could give 0 stars to this place the food was terrible and cold but the worst was the customer service the waitstaff and the management were rude and were rushing us to eat and get out they even came to the table and asked when are you leaving it was really disappointing as i was really excited to try this place due to the reviews i wouldn't recommend,negative
rTXNiH-RROF1OQHVIn5qJQ,i would like to give the restaurant an excellent review but the service from the young lady at the front door is horrible i presented for lunch and was pointed to the table i should occupy with no eye contact or greeting this same young lady just collected my check with no words and no eye contact or a thank you so i received no official welcome to the restaurant and no official thanks wow i don't think i'll be returning lack of good customer service is a deal breaker,negative
o7YE1WaFeQg_piECb9cgjQ,very poor quality of service waitress doesn't have any experience to serve customers brought up the wrong orders have no idea about food the food is not great as before completely cold duck without enough curry sauce pad thai tastes like instant noodles i guess all of these because it's under new ownership feel very upset that one of favorite restaurant is gone,negative
jvdIWqRw2h0EtYZz6NEp9A,this place is horrible i ordered the tuna tataki and mongolian beef the order taker did not speak english and i ended up ordering by number first of all it took over 45 minutes and i live 3 blocks away second the order was completly wrong it was mongolian chicken and spicy tuna roll i immediately called and attempted to explain what happened to the nonenglish speaking order taker she put someone else on the phone who said i would have to pay the difference if i wanted the correct order at this point i was so hungry i said to forget it and i ate my wrong order the sushi was rotten i took one bite and could tell it was rancid i opened up one of the rolls and the tuna was greenish and smelled like death do yourself a favor and avoid,negative
vUkiYPpbkMXA99WneLSGkQ,this place had tables upon tables of drunk loud local college students on a saturday evening it was not an enjoyable experience from reading other comments this happens occasionally,negative
x8djQAyYn5L-E5lgqRAq-w,not only am i profoundly disappointed but i'm concerned for the safety of people eating at this restaurant  my family frequently used to eat at the sarasota location of this restaurant but we moved so we wanted to try the dale mabry location  this was a mistake  all 3 of us ordered shrimp and one of us ordered scallops as well  the food came out really undercooked and the scallops were actually raw  the shrimp were noticeably stale  i took one bite of mine and flagged down the server  she was quite polite and brought out the owner  the owner offered to re cook the food but my stomach had turned sour and that doesn't address the lack of fresh seafood anyway  it's not safe to serve stale seafood and then also undercook it  they still charged us for the food   i would not recommend anyone eat here and we will not be back,negative
_uN0OudeJ3Zl_tf6nxg5ww,i got the pad thai and it's very blah not enough seasoning and it's just not worth the price go somewhere else,negative
9ggQrirrHCzOTFoSv0Zyhw,man this place got the best location in the mall but every time i walk by i feel like i have to zoom by so they don't try to shove free samples down my throat there's really nothing thai about ruby thai kitchen may be the owner's name is ruby thai but they are chinese food borderlines chinese flavors more than thai food and even then it's pretty flavorless  you probably should just skip any restaurant in the mall,negative
NOBXu1eDYKFg8P3oys4LGg,food was decent was made to order the way we wanted it good sized portions and lots of varieties and permutations with the meats but when we got our appetizers they gave us plates that had food crumbs and sauces on them we asked for new ones and got clean plates we asked for a missing place setting and had to ask several times before we got it we asked for chopsticks and the staff forgot and we again had to ask multiple times we ordered drinks and they forgot and we had to remind them to top things off we sat by the windowsill that had a candle in a glass container at the end of the meal the glass container exploded and hot wax got on one of our friends glass was all over the floors not a single staff member responded even though all the other diners were alarmed it took multiple tries of asking for ice and asking for someone to clean up the glass shards for them to do anything finally they tried to offer us 50 off or a gift card no thanks we won't be coming back here,negative
Tmmf74MfbNNFNvFNuavxrQ,restaurant is clean and service is good felt that the food very americanized i understand they are marketing to a predominately white and thai naive clientele but nonetheless disappoints sauces tastes sweet spice levels are dumbed down and lastly was refused choppedground chicken in pad ka pao spicy basil stir fry i can't take the place seriously if they don't accommodate cooking pad ka pao in its authentic manner i am not trying to place this restaurant up against the type of thai food in chicago or la but am more so reviewing against other restaurants in metro indy or bloomington good intro level thai food but not as satisfying for more seasoned palates,negative
8b_Zj4mREGewT3S1BhoK3A,disappointed the reviews looked decent so i ordered something simple  chicken pad thai i ordered 3 out of 5 on the spicy scale either they got the order wrong forgot to add the spice or my taste buds have become numb zero spice none i would have asked the waiter to confirm the 35 but he was on his phone the whole timeall of that said it wasn't bad hence the 2star not 1 rating but it wasn't anything special i don't plan on returning,negative
ty6H-2zkK-8IQbhjUfs-8g,bad service switched my friend's and my food with different spicy level the waiter's attitude is so bad,negative
FlyfDPS41F8R9f5KHA8g2Q,as others have stated the food is uninspiring old tasting and the portions are tiny  tom ka kai had 4 pieces of chicken 4 pieces of mushroom floating in  12 oz of lukewarm coconut milk broth  i asked for spicy but it there was none chicken satay was flat flavorless and over marinated as it fell easily off the stick  peanut sauce was again flavorless except for salt they use a lot of fish sauce to things so the main flavor is salty  thus far i have failed to find reasonably good thai or chinese food in nola  next time i will go somewhere for a po'boy,negative
NwJoFxmYRDxVGXgPtrjQ3w,really disappointed in the meal food bland and tasted like the chef was not thai the appetizer soup was fragrant and delicate but flavorful the egg roll minuscule  i did not like it but my husband did panang curry was mild and had little flavor the pad thai duck special was almost in edible my husband has never left pad thai or duck on his plate but he could only eat halfthe atmosphere is beautiful,negative
61fGIOE0DxjkZXE5wFDTqg,it was my first time after seeing the reviews i ordered  take out pad thai and coconut chicken soup not pleased at all with presentation and taste very poor presentation and no appetizing look of the food no authentic taste at all i felt very disappointed that i drove 32 minutes each way to get the food which was a total waste of money and time will never go again,negative
JXucCTkmYXql9C8HGPbG4Q,i hate to give this place 2 stars but i was really upset with my experience last night me and one of my good friends decided to eat there last night before a night out on the town i order the condition pho and she ordered sushi it literally took us 45 minutes to get our food i've been serving tables since 15 and i know you should always check on your tables every 15 minutes to see how we were doing right the girl never checked on us to tell us our food was gonna take some time i was so upset and starving maybe it was a bad night or something the restaurant wasn't full at all the pho was okay,negative
U0xnFDNnxapnjUU7BJoibw,update on sunday evening 227 i called in ordered the phad thai prawns 1695 a sushi roll and a cucumber salad receipt shows 2723 at 803p while the salad and avocado roll was good i was horrified shocked and initially extremely concern about my health the large beautiful looking shrimp that topped my phad thai immediately gave me a sour taste and what felt like a buring sensation on my tounge a tingle i proceeded to smell the other shrimp and notice that foul order that we all know signifies badspoiled seafood i tossed my entire meal due to the fear my noodles were likely contaminated as well thankfully i didnt get sick and more importantly my girls didn't eat any i called back granted it was the next day to alert them of what happened and not wating to post on yelp before callingand the female who answered offered no type of compensation not that it was expected since i didnt drive back with my meal sunday nightbut come on where is the customer service she barely offered a sincere apology and then just hung up i love thai foodthis is once again a disappointing experienceespecially since its in my neighborhood ughhh,negative
qWretbXJ-inUy1ywE7r3xQ,do not order delivery from here i did via door dash and got the wrong food the woman at the restaurant who was very annoyed at the situation said she couldn't bring me the right food as their driver doesn't come till 5pm when i asked for credit she couldn't figure that out and said she would call me back door dash ended up giving me credit but now i have no lunch and the woman never called me back sad because i love their food but now feel i can't go back there because of poor customer service,negative
f9H3wpzWG_apxoumWB-Dvg,2016 brought a lot of disappointments unfortunately this is two of them since i came here twice lol maybe i'm getting ahead of myself ambiance is really nice quiet and intimate atmosphere datenight  i was really excited to taste the food just because of how the place is set up i wait for a friend to show up and then peruse the menu it has a lot of staples that you can find at any thai restaurant and then a few specialties i was immediately drawn to the countryside authentic portion of the menu especially the warning disclaimer underneath it specifying that it's hot aka please don't sue we warned you pansies for the first time in my life i'm scared and excited about food at the same time scarecited if you will i ask the waitress what the spiciest thing on the menu is and she answers that everything on the countryside menu is hot really narrows it down righti end up getting andaman hunter damn food you threatenin' it came with shrimp squid and scallop topped with tilapia i'm finally about to dig in i'm sweating with scarecitement i'm thinking ooh sweet baby jesus this is it i take a bitewhere's the spice i sat taken aback and in complete and utter awe thinkingwho was that warning for must be for people that think sriracha is spicy yes not so silently judging you lol while the dish tasted ok and was a healthier option to eat has yellow squash it was not spicy i call the waitress over and ask her if they can make it spicier she said that she'll ask the kitchen she ends up coming back with a jar of chili oiland tells me to add as much as i want i ended up adding 10 scoops i felt ripped off from the whole experience if they advertise it as crazy spicy then that is what i should receive not chili oil i ended up adding so much chili oil the dish barely tasted the same but at least it was spicy i went back the second time because this place is close to my friends house and he wanted to get something quick i didn't remember what i got didn't leave an impression so i just looked it up its called pork lava and i requested that they make it spicy as all get out unsurprisingly it wasn't spicy figureswill not be back unless it's the only thing open i recommend banana blossom on the west bank realspicy soyummy,negative
O-ceM1MY4N3bJZif4REVtA,just not good the sushi tasted old we were terribly disappointed still looking for a good thai place we had pad thai as well and it was not up to our standards,negative
44iEDjXk-WTI7JQxNh_qfg,a friend recommended this place set it was very good my so and i went and ordered the general tso chicken and the chicken fried rice we get and start eating and we look down and there is a dead fly and a dead roach in our food we left and will never go back why they are still open i have no clue they need to be shut down,negative
ANTj0UD-OS7Zod3mulUg6w,the second time i've had their chicken pad thai and i won't give this place a third try the first time i went our waiter forgot to place our order an hour later and after seeing several guests receive their food when they walked in after us we asked our server about our food he admitted he had forgotten i thought with all the good reviews maybe it was just a fluke night tonight i was craving chicken pad thai so i decided to give it for another try bad idea the chicken pad thai was absolutely terriblewatery and tasteless,negative
iUe-TY260U8zVG5MjKQt8A,my wife sisterinlaw and i just finished a takeout order from china king and it was handsdown the worst asian meal any of us had ever eaten i ordered a general tso chicken with shrimp meal general tso has always been one of my favorite dishes but this bore no resemblance to anything i've ever had wal mart's version is way better the chicken wasn't even breaded but was pieces of some mystery meat that had no flavor shrimp was a fair size but again flavorless twice as much tasteless vegetables as meat 90 went in the garbage ordered a side of crab rangoon crab stuffing was dried paste with no resemblance to crab my wife ordered a teriyaki chicken dish but couldn't eat very much of it either best part was the ridiculous price of 42 i would highly discourage anyone from wasting their money here as i'm posting this warning i'm actually starting to get a bit of an upset stomach so maybe this whole experience isn't over yet,negative
90aL9Gyqo2fv8wcy7bTvDQ,i was here when it the seafood placenice to see a changegreat atmosphere and very relaxing staff was pleasant and helpful menu had much to choose from good for not sushi lovers toowe had the peking duck appetizervery good too small a portion as two each was not happeningwe also ordered a poseidon red dragon  18 each a bit steep if you ask me my son who was my date even commented about the costand volcano dragon and spicy yellowtail along with a sapporo and kirinthe total was just under 100i wehave had sushi many places in and out of the state as well the country totally outrageous i don't mind paying but it wasn't that awesome to priced so highwas my first and last visitthere are many other places that have tasty sushi close by here that don't charge you just because they canonly go if your pockets are fill and your not really that hungry l,negative
KzgI3kFHxYdf-l3e0U-mdw,i ordered the drunken noodles with chicken pad seeew with beef and the crispy rolls for delivery through grubhub the drunken noodles were pretty good but the pad seeew was barely tolerable it had no flavor at all and the beef was very dry and chewy the crispy rolls also had no flavor but luckily i got a side of peanut sauce to drown them in which significantly helped probably would not go back,negative
LOERTipUKUhDq6BayAXqUg,i ordered 5 boxes of food to go and they only gave me 1 chopstick no fork no spoon no napkin and they gave me a normal sushi roll which i ordered a special roll,negative
hM611cPF2RlyqDHq7NACog,worst food ordered take out and ordered pad see ew which is traditionally a wide rice noodle i assumed this to be true here as well as any other restaurant as his is a usual order that i place at any thai restaurant u have ever eaten at however they were very thin noodles i accepted this and gave he food a shot the noodles were very dry hard and chewy and basically not edible there was zero flavor at all when i called to complain i was told that if i ordered in dining vs take out they would have been better what kind of restaurant says that to a customer never going back and i'd advise anyone to avoid this place,negative
SjCxvaC-OZLnOqAqHTXG_Q,i love thai but i really did not like this food  the place borders on eclectic versus odd and stuffy  i would have to go with the later  it was practically empty when i was there  my date got a curry chicken and the chicken was so dry he could barely eat it  we both got eggrolls and while they weren't bad they simply weren't very good,negative
KQctPnwwX0YRbrc7CCdOLg,never been here before and no plans to return i was disappointed from the staff who where rude and no help  i was finally seated and started to order  we both ordered garlic chicken with vegetable fried rice i didn't like mine cold,negative
FP_2UO9f5Mn1OV3tq9ebHw,heard so many great reviews had to try it went with a friend very underwhelming overall experience was disappointing service was slow even though there were only a couple other tables present ambiance was what you'd expect for a strip mall in chalmette ordered the pad thai and chicken curry both dishes were way over spiced and the curry was a gelatinous mess inedible i've had thai food all around the country and all over thailand and never have i had someone serve me food that was this over spiced and i like spicy food thought maybe i had miscommunicated my order or caught them on an off day so i tried them again a month later ordered different dishes and asked for as little spice as possible but had the exact same experience i guess if you don't want to taste your food or if you love having your mouth on fire then you'll love this place portions are generous prices are very reasonable but the food service and ambiance all leave a lot to be desired,negative
e2_MIdH-CzuWSmLQ7vNC9A,malaysian food is one of my favorite cuisines i ate here once when it was sam's but it was only okay went back after reading the reviews and wanted to try it since it's under a new ownership what a big disappointment food and service wise  the waiters are inexperienced teenage boys who do not pay much attention to the customers except when it's time to pay and tip them if you sit in the top seating area you literally need to stand up from your seat and flag them down we ordered the roti canai and it was too thick and doughy unlike other malaysian restaurants in ny ca or philly chinatown which make it thin flaky and crispy the curry dip only came with bits of potatoes where as the other restaurants normally serve it with pieces of chicken and potatoes we also ordered pho and chicken mee siam which didn't come out until 40 minutes later not sure why it took so long as the restaurant wasn't that busy  not once did the waiters check on us even though we keep turning our head towards the kitchen in the back to see if the food was coming when it finally came i couldn't believe how tiny the portions were for the price it looked like a kid's meal the pho was in a small soup bowl and missing the side dish of bean sprouts lime wedges and mint the broth was from an instant soup mix and tastes artificial yuck next time we're sticking to pho street if we want an authentic steamy bowl of pho as for the mee siam it was flavorless so i had to use alot of chili oil and the remaining curry dip sauce to eat it  we had also ordered a beef mee siam to go i regret ordering it as we didn't know the food was this nasty when we asked for the check i also asked about the take out the waiter said it'll be a couple of minutes omg a couple of minutes turned out to be half an hour wish he would have been honest and admit that he forgot about it so that we could cancel the order  also he was standing there by our table watching how much we tipped him which is extremely rude we were in the restaurant for almost 2 hours wasted our evening never stepping foot in here again,negative
JaGiya5J9uPb1znq-B9X5A,i used to love this place i even had them cater a party for me a few years back since then they've become inconsistent one night my mom ordered a spicy dish and it came out as described the next time my dad got the same thing and she tried it and both felt that it was not only completely different but inedible in terms of being intensely hotthe most recent time i went my appetizer which i had ordered numerous times previously was completely bland so was my spicy curry which i sent back it came back a second time as a bland bowl of noodles and tofu with a few red pepper flakesalways sad to see a formerly great restaurant go down hill my last time was my last i've had thai food all over philly south jersey and nyc  this was hands down the worst thai i've ever had,negative
hVwmnQAgZpVbEoWayzASQg,what happened tivoli's used to be a favorite spot for late night eating for me and my friends it's been a little while since i had been there but tonight my girlfriend and i decided to grab some food at the eldorado we walked into tivoli's and noticed that it had changed quite a bit the decor was different the menu had changed and overall it was a little odd sushi bar really i was craving an el camino and she decided on the caesar salad with blackened chicken it was late so we decided to grab our food to go after a short drive we live downtown we opened our food and to my astonishment my beloved el camino was different it was on a smaller roll there as less meat no avocado what happened then the worst i took a biteit tasted horrible it was didn't taste at all the same it was just pitiful then my girlfriend tasted her salad the blackened chicken was so spicy it was inedible literally inedible there was no flavor just insane amounts of heat needless to say this is a sad day for reno a late night staple turned to garbage i dare any of the carano family to eat this food and be satisfied,negative
HfJeU5-MzRGiO3nIJwnEqQ,i have been a customer here for years but feel the quality of the food has really declined while the space was never anything special it was always clean not so anymore it is dirty and understaffed,negative
KO7zaWqCLqjhDP-bxPfyDw,this is such a nice place friendly inviting great place for people watching the problem is that my meal was a disaster i started with the traditional hot and sour soup and a spring rollsafe right the soup was good spicy and a large serving for a cup of soup i waited on the spring roll but it didn't come i heard that the spicy cumin beef was great here i asked the server if rice came with it and she didn't understand me she eventually came back to the table and asked me what type of rice i wantedi specifically asked what was in the spicy cumin beef and she told me just beef and onion i had quite a surprise when it arrived with red bell peppers and jalapeños it wouldn't have been so bad except i'm allergic to bell peppers and i really didnt want to get sick  the manager came and it was whisked away leaving me with a bowl of white ricethen the spring roll came which was nothing more than cabbage in a wonton wrapperalmost inediblethe server returned at this point to ask if i was ready for the check whaaa i told her i hadn't even had my entreethen the manager came back with another cup of hot and sour soup this place is a comedy of errors after waiting 49 minutes the manager brought me a new spicy cumin beef but it still had the peppers in it  she said not to worry because the meal was comped  i could hardly contain myself  then the manager returned with the check and proudly announced she had given me a 10 discount  are these people smoking crack or what  i asked her if she was serious and she grabbed the check only to return in a few seconds with a tab for 437 i paid it an left in a huff this was a really awful experience in fact possibly the worst dining experience ever,negative
LViyOllt47lHXC9hZ69owA,bummer was my favorite thai hang out for nearly three years about  14 yrs ago when we lived on cw beach    super flavors great team fabian kitchenmoved to spb made little people and lost track of tp alley   drove back up with  my family last weekend and found 14 yrs of neglect and deterioration   bathroom door men's does not even have a working door knobit is like when a parent starts a business busts ass and creates something special then turns it over to the kids who never knew the fear of losing it all if your business failed they soak all the profits out of the business to fund  their unreal life style while the goose who  was laying the golden eggs dies a slow and undignified deathnote if prequalification  i have been brainwashed by my midwest upbringing to clean my plate    as well as being a product of the public school lunches and  the  surprise burger     even if it is semi palatable i will finish or take the remaining to finish lateri could not would clean my plate and will not will not return again     too many clean caring and delicious places in this area to choose from to ever waste my time and upset stomach again on this shell of what was a great little hang out    somebody who cares needs to take control and right the wrong that thai pan alley has become  it saddens my heart to see such a demise in my once favorite thai restaurant,negative

h4C7s_Go9UKo5twaLIWc8A,posted 42916 for my visit in mid march 2016thought i wrote this review when i visited over a month agoso a quick recap of that experience we walked in with one person at the bar two 2tops and a table of 16  as we walked in i saw the person and one 2top waiting for their checks the other 2top finishing their meal and the food being carried out to the table of 16it was around 30 minutes before we had our drinks  waterit was a little under an hour to have our second drink  waterthe whole time we watched food come out very slowly to the table of 16it was 70 minutes before we received our foodthe food had great presentation and the flavor was goodi requested a the spice level to be hot 5 out of 5 and my dinner companion asked for thai hotneither of us could detect any spice in our food42916 entry for my visit on 42816wanted to give chiang mia a second chanceservice was the typical broad ripple effectiveness  why do i think after all these years of living in broad ripple i would expect good servicefriends from out of town were with me  four different dishes for the four of usall looked great  all had good flavor and presentationall four of us grumped that there was no heatspice to our food  so if you are normally accustomed to thai food having a little even just a very little oomph to it then don't go to chiang mia  their concept of thai hot isn't enough for a toddler to think twice about eating it,negative
eaDZlSuVS0EY67Ke6pRP6Q,it's a shame i had good experiences there before but lately going down hill i got singapore street noodles they had lettuce and the dish was brown maybe they gave me the wrong dish i also got a roti canal appetizer it had a piece of potato i was always impressed with this place now i don't think i'll be going back after the last few experiences,negative
bCZFb9v6OQaNTgupVw9WEg,ordered chicken on a stick and it was raw like sushi raw just not chicken i called to notify them and she said if i get sick they will pay for it dialogue seemed rehearsed sounded like i wasn't the first to be told this fulins usually is really good,negative
7etaSB4-9MPhShMsdLWINg,the good beautiful decor you can tell a lot of thought was put into the design of this restaurant because it's gorgeous the food was tasty bathroom was very clean and smelled like lilacsthe bad our shrimp thai salad rolls didn't have any shrimp our waitress was too busy to flag down and tell her so we just ate them sans shrimp service was not great this is a newlyopened restaurant and it was busy the night we came so i wasn't expecting topnotch service we had to ask for the status of our entrees twice and then had to ask for our check because we had been waiting for it for so long our food took close to an hour to come out after we were seated we watched as all the tables around us got their entrees even if they were seated well after we were when the entrees finally arrived the food was lukewarm it was also very greasy more than i've experienced at other thai restaurantsthe ugly i watched as the male employee filled water glasses all around us and touched the same water pitcher to the rim of each glass he filled needless to say i didn't drink the refill he poured me it is flu season after alli'm hoping this place can work out the kinks if so it would be a jewel to have in the newlydeveloped downtown brownsburg area i will give it some time before i return,negative
WvxNHhiZkHHrkU0QyisHGg,the best sushi in sj hands down and very friendly owners ask for the chris roll it's the bomb,positive
2xxkaRy7rP5EUyjFt2J5kA,this was a fabulous discovery i was kind of skeptical when they gave us paper menus printed on regular printer paper and plastic disposable water cups but don't let that fool you there is some bomb af ramen there i personally recommend the thick noodles but i'm pretty sure the thin noodles come with more can we talk broth for a second the broth is super rich the pork bones have been boiled for 24 hours which gives the tendons a chance to disintegrate into the most delicious broth i've ever had the chance of experiencing before it's got this creaminess that coats your mouth and an umami flavor that regular shoyu or shio broth just doesn't have the other toppings were just there but honestly a distraction from the pork belly don't get the chicken and don't get the pork shoulder if you love yourself you'll get the pork belly it's surprisingly crispy and has this nice tender texture that feels almost unreal it melted in my mouth it was the star the absolute best thing i hope you come here to get your socks knocked off the only thing i think can beat this is a trip to japan already can't wait to come back,positive
xfmXbvTrtmfGxySJQ2TRXQ,the food was delicious and pretty affordable it had plenty of seating looked very clean and the staff were nice i felt bad for the waitress who was the only one waiting tables during a lunch rush this is a great place to go for lunch but i'm definitely coming back to try their dinner and great sake offerings,positive
fF0aVsxyI51ZfCZoN-F5GQ,why 5 stars because we've been here several times worth the schlep from st pete beach  it's always sooooooo good great staff new  creative options always available and delicious we love sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with the chefs best sushi in tampa imho,positive
YXaCcpETNtxrNNK6TbUTlw,this restaurant had delicious food and the service was great  i got the chicken teriyaki and it was delicious and the tempura that came on the side was great as well  even the miso soup that came with the meal was better than i usually have  highly recommend,positive
wMQMMxaGq0HPG0mApezXMw,i love the food here came to this restaurant on a whim because it was a new sushi place i hadn't tried before ended up getting the bento box and loved it went back a second time and it was just as good the miso egg rolls and katsu chicken are all great the gyoza was good but was delivered a little cold it had a nice crispy bottom but just must not have been cooked quite long enough since they were busy still tasty though the sushi isn't the best in the area but was still absolutely delicious,positive
K6ORcbEU1vpC0E7F3qes3Q,haven't tried the ramen yet although i'm excited to i personally like the onigiri and don bowls pretty big and a lot of food and i feel the prices are affordable the hours occasionally throw me off because i find myself craving kukai just around the time they're closed but that's neither here nor there they serve the food relatively quickly and the staff is always nice too,positive
94QsqKHMTRb7VQixpYTgCA,hidden gem in the tampa bay area fresh sushi and awesome staff my favorite roll is the hot and hot,positive
0R3SRPEYpqoUi3kq5ZsELw,tried this place today for the first time loved it i got the chicken melody salad and the sunrise golden smoothie for takeout i took a bite of the salad in the car because i was super hungry i wound up eating everything in my car because it was so delicious and fresh will definitely be back,positive
wD85uEvLs1ST-J2r_xUI_A,got around to going again this past week with a friend who was gracious enough to buy dinner this time around it was a lot more packed than when i first went by my lonesome it was a good test to see if the quality of service would go down or not with more people to serve to my pleasant surprise service was still topnotch the server came by to refill water constantly and the sushi was prepared in about 10 to 15 minutes the sushi pieces seemed to have gotten a little bit smaller but not anything to complain about because they still give the right amount of rice it was good to see a lot of people there because i'd like to have a sushi buffet to go to in stl that won't leave me unsatisfied in my time here if you haven't yet check out sushi ai,positive
PxRt1rrcTxN3IbieAdRdTQ,happy teriyaki on riverside in eagle just might be the best fastteriyaki place in the treasure valley what separates this location from other ones i have visited are the flavors portion sizes service and cleanliness  i ordered the chicken teriyaki with beef meal and an order of gyoza  the chicken was moist and delicious but the beef stole the show  most of the time at these type of fastfood teriyaki restaurants the flavors come from the sauce they pour over the meat  that is definitely not the case with the beef at happy teriyaki  i took a bite of the meat without any added sauce and immediately noticed that the teriyaki flavor was infused throughout the meat  you really did not need the sauce at all  the chicken and beef meal came with steamed cabbage which was a nice alternative to the overdressed salad greens typically served at teriyaki restaurants this meal was enough for 2 people but was reasonably priced  as for the gyoza they were decent considering they were preprepared  frozen items that were deep fried  i will definitely come back for teriyaki at this restaurant,positive
r0g6naqWCKdKcTWuYibtNQ,this is definitely the best spot for sushi in dtsp the food and atmosphere are great but amanda and donny make it soooo much better,positive
b6_HDIygAfbG9SZWbZMD_g,best sushi in indy hands down salmon is delicious and the 5 roll is always tasty highly recommended for any sushi lovers,positive
J1bG9ezYHMkzqV1yRsVtQQ,heeyahthat is my kung fu chopping noise while on a quick business trip to nola i had dinner here one night with a few coworkers we had the white ninja as recommended by the waitress and it was delicious it had the perfect amount of spice crunch and sweet it seemed like their specialty rolls all had a lot of ingredients and often that means the fish jut isn't that good so they add tons of everything else but these were all really good one of the appetizers we got was with spinach and scallopsit was the best part of the meal if you like scallops you should absolutely get that,positive
fF0aVsxyI51ZfCZoN-F5GQ,no better place to go in tampa for sushi seriously hands down my favorite restaurant in the entire city whether you eat in or get their curbside to go  the food is always consistent and delicious my fav roll is the kiss of fire crab rangoon  best i've ever had and omg the fried oreos are to die for sushi chefs are fantastic as are the waitresses i'm guilty of trying to recruit one to come work with me lol but seriously thanks soho sushi for everything best in tpa,positive

6_T2xzR74JqGCTPefAD8Tw,came to philadelphia for work and decided to check out the most popular japanese restaurant in town so ventured several blocks from my hotel to morimoto the neighbourhood seemed pretty safe but then again it was just hours before the second blizzard to hit philly this winter so it wasn't a typical tuesday night  having read some reviews prior to heading over the decor was definitely contemporary as expected and atypical of a japanese restaurant but these days that's not uncommon  personally i would have preffered a more classy japanese feel for a full cultural experience but cultural differences are all getting fuzzy these days  what about the food then  i started with the miso soup and i have to say it was the best ever  i liked how it had chunks of soft tofu rather than littl diced guys  i truely enjoyed it except it was probably meant to seve 3 or 4 people and i could have done without the main course and left quite satisfied  i ordered the 30 dollar sushimaki combo and the fish was really fresh and tasty and just the right amount of foodbut as i realized later it was the soup that filled me up and my tummy was growling again after a few hours  bottom line great food cool interior and well not too pricey if you get to expense it or dine out once in a while  also great for the single diners as you can sit at the sushi bar and be oblivious off the  other diners  next time i'm trying the ramen noodle for lunchshould be great hangover food,positive
JnJzamlUgYY37uzf5Nav9A,i eat sushi about once every other week this is one of my go to place always get great service and food the 30 sashimi regular definitely worth the money you get about 30 piece of fish of at least 7 types beef tataki is always cook perfectly medium rare wasabi is just the way i like it potent,positive
i76ERS3jM111T3VMbi2yrQ,loved this place awesome service and fresh fresh fish i especially liked grilled yellowtail and their sushi pieces very fresh and not sparing in the amount of fish  i hate it when places skim on the fish adn give you a big blob of rice with thin layer of fish the selections are not as great as those americanized sushi places where they have super fancy rolls but the basicsimple rolls are solid would definitely go back,positive
wexGsdw5Wz85-hOBx9r2Tg,great for good takeout japanese foodthe rice meals are very good although i am not a fan of their ramen the restaurant is cramped and dirty the time it takes to get the food is also slow at times,positive
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,i enjoyed every piece of the sushi and think it is a fine place to dine however since it is a small place waiting for a table can drag for a long time i suggest visiting off peak hours,positive
EPkF-beh6gg_s3HtlAdfiw,goleta sushi house is unassuming but it's definitely a hidden gem in old town goleta service is super fast and friendly everyone is knowledgeable they don't have pictures on the menu but if you look on yelp you'll see what others have ordered we got the catalina roll which is my favorite and a few other basic rolls everything is fresh and delicious parking can be trickyjust park on the street overall you should definitely come and check it out,positive
0BXnGq6eJuiWR7270TipoA,we came here for lunch on saturday and found it to be a great sushi spot they check your temperature before entering the restaurant there weren't spacing between tables but they do wipe down the tables and chairs between customers i loved that the price and what you get were fair and super delicious we thought the specials or new menu writings everywhere were a bit messy looking in appearance but not a deal breaker our appetizer was wrong but they were also super busy so it wasn't that big a deal the service is top notch as they all communicate with each other and get you what you need before you look for someone we'll definitely come back to try other things and make this our sushi spot in the future,positive
VhBW615VRkiQLP03oAZ59Q,great food and great atmosphere not a big fan of the honolulu but love the dragon mountain and the eel ,positive
LVRRjPZZ2pRrOUbBN1rRCA,we had the early bird special not a bad deal at all i'll work backwards because the appetizer was truly the best part of the meal altho we enjoyed everything the key lime pie was ok we ate it up but i'm glad it was part of the special bc it wasn't a huge piece plus i like my key lime pie a tad bit more tart the limes are so sweet on their own but that's me since we each got a slice we do have some for later i wish you could choose your pie with the special because i wanted lemon but i'm just quibbling no biggie vegetarian bowl was tasty not too salty at all i really like the arugula floating in my bowl a lot not a lot of complex flavors but that's what it's suppose to be noodles were excellent i got mine with out egg bc i don't do eggs still the best part was at the beginning the shrimp fries were really tasty french fries dusted  with dried shrimp powder i would have stolen more off his plate if i had not been just digging my fried brussels sprouts  i shared with him but i didn't want to oh man lots of carmelized leaves the insides even the bigger sprouts cooked perfectly tender but not overcooked yummy sauce and a little panko crunch i could eat more now i would go again might try a sake cocktail,positive

P8QLcGZZOPgl9w_3ARBKiQ,finally the sushirrito has come to philadelphiain the bay area i remember hearing all of the hype surrounding this new foodie trend in san francisco so i was really excited to hear about it coming to philadelphiai tried the hai street chicken roll with chicken katsu and added the wasabi guacamole the chicken katsu was delicious as was the rest of the burrito i thought it was fairly sized as well as fairly priced the wasabi guacamole didn't have a strong enough flavor for me and thus i'd probably opt out of that extra charge next timethough i did not think it was absolutely amazing and mindblowing i think it's a really solid lunchdinner option and i'm glad it is now in ucityi really want to to try the bowl option next have heard great things i really think this place will continue to be successful,positive

bZ1Q106Bmt6tR3Y3yiAADg,i recently ate at ajia before a concert i attended at world cafe live and my experience there was much better than it was the first time i had eaten there 3 years ago  the sushi was yummy and the place wasn't crowded either so i was in and out of there in about a half an hour or less  good service too ,positive
OZi0fOn8-ISUwhEAWC_8Gg,two ten jack a japaneseinspired gastropub izakaya had been at the top of my list to try for a while ever since i had met a chef in nashville who told me it was his favorite place to eat in the city that to me said a lot about someone who works in that industry although i can say after dining here that it is not my favorite place i understand why he enjoys it and i think that the atmosphere is very interestingtrendy and the food is greatatmosphere 45two ten jack looks very subtle from the outside with a single red lantern hanging by the door walk past the small outdoor patio and enter through the front door on the brick wall and you will know you've arrived even if no sign indicates it to you the inside is dimly lit and has an industrialfeel to it with simple japanese decor although we came around 9 pm on a thursday night the place was still filled with patrons we did not have a reservation but were able to get seated within 5 minutes service 35we were greeted by some very friendly servers upon entering but our server was not very friendly she was quick about taking our order and checking on us but she had a bit of an attitude when she saw that my water was empty she casually snipped there's water on the table and pointed to a glass container with water it's fine that she didn't just pour it for me but she definitely wasn't the type that goes the extra mile fooddrink 55the food menu offers a variety of japaneseinspired specialties including small plates like gyoza dumplings takoyaki fried octopus ball sashimi  nigiri yakitori salads  noodles and ramen the drink menu has a variety of whisky beer wine and cocktails my sister and i both ordered the tonkotsu ramen 14 which was honestly nothing short of amazing my sister lives in california and eats at ramen places frequently but said that this ramen even beats a really popularfamous place she goes to if you are thinking that this is similar to those 50 packets of ramen at the store you are dead wrong the ramen has a creamy salty broth a large piece of very wellseasoned chashu pork the pork in ramen is usually so fatty this one was not which i loved what tasted like homemade noodles scallions bamboo shoots and topped with a soft boiled egg i ate the whole bowl they don't allow you to take your leftover ramen home and kind of hated myself afterwards but it was worth it overall 45on the expensive side but definitely the best ramen handsdown in nashville i'm a person who doesn't really like crowds and i've tried to come on a weekend before only to be met with really long wait times which is probably the reason i wouldn't dine here too much i was a little turned off my our server as well but the other staff here seemed pretty nice so i think that may have just been our experience,positive
vP6BGF8IqbXlLQiDP5n6dA,absolutely deliciousme  my husband got the spicy  maki tuna roll and  spicy island roll both were deliciousthe rolls weren't rolled tight enough and fell apart when we ate each one but we managedi ordered the seafood combination all was delicious hubby ordered filet and shrimp he said that the steak was ribeye not filet and was toughdespite the sushi roll  steak situation we will returnservice was excellent by hostess server and cookrestaurant was neat tidy and very clean as were the bathrooms,positive
EVmCBFlY0Hy_62bDRizmGA,i arrived at sushi alive close to closing time the hostesses were extremely welcoming and didn't seem to mind we were pushing it so close to closing our waitress was extremely nice and got us everything we requested i only got their sushi so my review will be on that for drinks i tried their sake sangria and their hot sake their sake sangria was tasty i couldn't really taste the sake much but i didn't mind that too much i enjoyed adding the lemon and lime in it it gave it a nice kick their sake came out a bit warm i like my sake hot when we let our waitress know she took it back and brought back an extra hot sake on the sushi side i got the eel nigiri octopus nigiri and the gator roll everything was delicious the only thing i would give criticism on is the octopus the octopus nigiri we received was a bit chewy octopus is naturally a little chewy in order to make it less chewy it has to be cut a certain way it wasn't inedible and i still really liked the flavor definitely will come again,positive
1wbIkxqILqNjp6aNe5mr6A,love this location nice to have a space to eat as well wait was a little long but definitely worth it the tantamen is my go to these days thanks otaku,positive
ZMejgg0By-DI2wyQWezBbQ,i had to bump my review to 4 stars  we've eaten here and ordered from here a lot since my last review  the service is always really good and the food is just what we want  lancaster ave location is nice but we miss the old location  all the ramens are tasty and being able to order a vegan ramen is a huge plus,positive
27aORpwVDxyBA-E2ysOQ6Q,i'm always pleased with kung fu tea my favorites are the green milk tea and yogurt tea,positive
ab3pRv-b0o-BwMK2jVbH3Q,my husband and i found out this place from a friend who highly recommended it it says the place closes at 10pm we got there at 9 but found out that the kitchen closes at 930pm we had to rush and order everything it would have been nice to be there earlier to relax and take time to order one dish at a time the food was really good though  the desert was also included in the price it would be a good date place,positive
KS7dLySzzZNC8q1Y_WIo8A,this is my fav location of shogun  they havr habachi or you can eat on side w out also outdoor seating and sushi great for groups or date or family you'll like it chicken or steak or veggie it's all good,positive
X92wH5Y38oxvIHPUA1c6fQ,we had a very pleasant dinning experience  the tonkatsu ramen was to die for  the sushi rolls and other selections in the menu all looks good  we filled our stomach  the owner who is very nice welcomed us and all the staff reflects her hospitality  tony our server was excellent,positive
oiFw8lJrYUZ4zrffWwWiBg,an awesome restaurant the all you can eat sushi option is not only the best all you can eat option but their sushi is amazing and some of the best sushi i have ever had the peppered tuna sushi is to die for something i crave and can only be satisfied here,positive
aAjOFpX5SBSoDkAsBSZeZw,omg incredible ramen the broth was so flavorful and the drinks were great i'm excited to go back  service was insane too so timely and kind new fav ramen spot ,positive
e747H7dlPXtZPo6VdSQelw,i've recently developed a liking for ramen and have been ordering it whenever i can on my travels so far aki nom nom has been the best  and their sushi rolls are pretty darned good too they have a nice variety of both offerings ramen and sushi and though it's a bit pricey i think that's normal for this part of the city the restaurant is busy and pleasantly noisy the only thing that i bumped the rating down for is the fact that they're understaffed for the number of customers so service is friendly but harried and slowish,positive
2xxkaRy7rP5EUyjFt2J5kA,my so and i absolutely loved the tonkotsu shiro ramen the broth is strong in pork flavor creamy and delicious i haven't had tonkotsu broth that tastes amazing in such a long time he opted for chashu chicken and i opted for the pork belly both meats were soft and the pork belly fat dissolves in your mouth  it was braised very well we will definitely make future visits to this place but probably split a bowl because the portions were too big for either of us to finishdelicious food but a side note to consider it would be better if the menus were laminated and i wasn't a fan of the plastic cups  hopefully you guys recycle them and transition to glassware,positive
g3xvwZPyW95KThnc7tN79w,food was delicious best ramen i've had service was quick recommend their signature ramen,positive
vXQLdqB-stL2JTP5AsPVaA,for our first official outing as tampa residents and to celebrate a successful closing on our home my husband surprised me by taking me here for dinner located in centro ybor the restaurant itself is quite charming it's very cozy so tables are close together and it's not a large space that makes this place a nice spot for date night forces you to get close to your hunni however i was absolutely in love with the high ceilings and the exposed brick on the walls a nice change from the typical japanese decor in most places the sushi was amazing it's so fresh and the rolls are a good size we practically inhaled our 4 rolls and we were so full at the end of our meal we ordered the eel rainbow volcano and salmon rolls we also started with their age dashi tofu starter a personal favorite it wasn't the best i've ever had but it was still good enough to satisfy my cravingthe service was on point as well i would highly recommend making a reservation though we came on a thursday night for dinner and they were packed just goes to show how good a place is if they're full on a weeknighti'd like to consider myself a sushilover my sushi sensie yelp badge can vouch for that and i'll honestly say this is some of the best sushi i've had in a while i would highly recommend this place to anyone,positive
VhBW615VRkiQLP03oAZ59Q,i usually got to ijji in sparks when i want sushi because it's closer to my home than the others i ended up at this one because my sister and her friends wanted to eat there i was interested to see the steakhouse i could see from my seat the chefs cooking over their fire at the steakhouse and looks like a great experience we however had the sushi which met all my expectations since i am a regular at the one in sparks it is a bummer that you can't order from the steakhouse if you're having sushi i was not completely in the mood for sushi but majority ruled i will make it point to drive the 45 minutes to check out the steakhouse next time,positive
Vf0inZOaad8sv1uG8mGIGw,i had a great experience for my birthday tonight yabu and danny boi are absolutely amazing and made it so fun for me we had such a good time everyone laughed and really enjoyed them both we will be back and i'm specifically requesting those 2,positive
yZ6g2mWmMKNqtZivW4Nv5w,when i want my quick fix for sushisalmon this is my go to place i usually order on my phone so it's ready when i get there location is great since it's in between kung fu tea and tous les jour so you'll never have to worry about drinks or dessert parking lot has been packed the last few times that i went but turnaround is pretty quick so be patient,positive
g3xvwZPyW95KThnc7tN79w,ramen is good but the takoyaki and curry tonkatsu rice bowls are something else the takoyaki is the best in philly by far  there are generally 3 large chunks of octopus per piece which is the way it is supposed to be but other restraints are too cheap to makegreat place eat there at least once a month,positive
6LyhttbsQn6a6PDxQDojCw,most of the food here is pretty stellar the full hibachi dinner with the filet mignon is amazingly goodthough a bit too salty i also love the christmas roll pork gioza and fried tempura sweet potatothe one dish that i really didn't like at all was the chicken hibachi that i ordered off the menuit had that rubbery texture that many chain restaurant chicken has for some reason it tastes completely different than the hibachi chicken they cook in front of you all in all great food friendly staff nice atmosphere my only complaints so far is the kitchen cooked hibachi chicken the watered down tasting sodas and the chef's putting shrimp in my rolls when i ask for only crabi'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good asian food with friendly service they're very professional,positive
fF0aVsxyI51ZfCZoN-F5GQ,i was visiting tampa for a few days and my friend knowing i love sushi brought me here the first night i took my first bite from the volcano roll and was pleasantly surprised at how well prepared it was but then i tried the kamikaze roll and i almost fell out of my seat thank goodness it was a bench i literally paused in amazement and gave my friend the areyoukiddingmethisissogood look i couldn't believe how fresh and perfectly flavorful the roll was i eat sushi a lot i mean to the point where i'm on a sushi budget because i can go overboard and this roll was by far one of the best if not the best i have ever tasted in fact all the rolls exceeding my expectations if not for my short trip i would have been back again before i left to top it off the service was great the waiter who i believe was also the owner awesome work ethic was attentive checking in with us regularly you definitely can't ask for more no doubt each time i visit tampa soho sushi will be my first stop,positive
hTL8J3fSb0ijEabyRxSoHg,simply my favorite restaurant in boise flavorful food cooked excellent every time brown rice zen salad is my usual i even bought the dressing to attempt to duplicate it at home,positive
RscMwBafa1cZh94tGlZT_Q,we've been to ichiban twice not for their teppanyaki which imo is the most redonkulous thing ever well unless i was 5years old and didn't care exactly what was being cooked it's all just a show right  but instead we head here for their ayce sushiseating at their sushi bar can be pretty tough especially if you have a big group apparently no one follows the 1hour limit rule so why should you rightboth times i've been here with the so we were with the cousins who are hardcore sushi lovers so pretty much if they're noshing like crazy it must be good and i'll agree it was pretty damn goodi don't remember the names of the rolls as we each ordered and shared everything between each other  i do remember them ordering salmon skin handrolls and filet mignon hamachi like crazy  for 2795 per person we totally got our money's worthalso our sushi chef was this older asian lady  she was friendly and so amusing  she kept asking what we wanted to order then she'd go andand we didn't think she'd remember all of our orders but she whipped them up hella quick without missing one rolls  she seriously deserved her tipi'd totally recommend ichiban if you're in reno and in the mood for sushi  we used to go to sushi pier but if you don't feel like driving from the main casinos then this is your best bet,positive
I7GoKXrd_k5_ObTWWgkWDQ,excellent sushi superb value this is not an all you can eat cattle shoot this is a sit all inclusive restaurant great appetizer especially the crab salad and seafood udon sushi and sashimi are excellent definitely worth the visit you will thank me,positive
8Vo6LN9gqULhXzoxj5k6kQ,santa barbara needs more restaurants like the black sheep the menu is adventurous and the food is delicious the bone marrow bruschetta can't be missed the risotto beef cheeks and carpaccio are sensational the added bonus is that the owners and staff create a friendly vibe that makes it feel like you are dining at the home of a good friend,positive
JnJzamlUgYY37uzf5Nav9A,stopped in for a late lunch the simplest salad was so refreshing cucumber and soy sauce the sushi was top notch when a person orders water please don't give them the look of death overall the hostess was very enjoyable and friendly only reason i gave four stars sushi chef had his ear buds in totally incorrect,positive
v2tctxDffyuHiNGSfb4Umw,this place is decent for the area and the atmosphere is good i have eaten sushi chinese and thai here and all of it was good we will be back,positive
40O7uKX-uAG_JDrS-OM85w,when it comes to sushi in the city there are tons of options but no one with the consistent deliciousness and truly inspirational rolls that this spot has i'm a suburban sushi girl blue fin all the way but even they haven't come up with some inspirational rolls like the godzilla and the enternal sunshine roll be sure these rolls are expensive but the most you need are 2 specialty rolls and a regular but delicious spicey crunky tuna ,positive
aYHjJJ64whQsxZjx5rUe_w,i had a lovely late lunch here on christmas eve with my brother  the food was delicious and it will definitely be one of my favorite japanese spots to hit up in tucson whenever i'm in townit's spacious clean and aesthetic inside of the restaurant  there's a modern yet traditional feel at the same time to it and the dark ambiance gives off a great vibe  there's also outdoor seating available although it was cloudy on the day that we went  service was very friendly and efficient  they quickly took our order and had the drinks out  the food all followed shortly afteri loved the garlic edamame  perfectly seasoned and tasted amazing  i also loved my poke bowl  my brother got some teriyaki yakisoba and thoroughly enjoyed it and devoured the plate as well  i was thoroughly pleased and impressed with this meal  i will be sure to return whenever i am looking for an asian restaurant in the tucson area to go to,positive
w__UZfNB79VSXmFUWhAVyA,nama on a thursday night for half off sushi done and done although there is only a limited amount of half price sushi you can choose from the price definitely makes up for it crunchy shrimp for 450 hell yes the interior is very spacious and dark might need to bring a flashlight next time to see the menu i ordered the crunchy shrimp and spicy tuna the crunchy shrimp was absolutely delicious hello crunchy shrimp and goodbye mickey d's jk mickey d's you will forever have a place in my heart the spicy tuna on the other hand was really fishy and didn't taste fresh at all yuck that just means two orders of crunchy shrimp in the future,positive
DKyJMM2209QrTgclzoCUpw,this is one of my go to lunch places in my neighborhood the maki specials for lunch are spot on and you get so much sushi for the money i like the crunchy bagel roll but i'm a plain sushi kind of girl pretty okay service decent food great prices right down the street you can find me there most weeks,positive
KjwrNpjp0wkovwKydQ3tWw,this was our first time ordering food in over a year due to the pandemic we also moved right before it began so we don't know the restaurants in town but the food was excellent and we will definitely be ordering again and hopefully dining in the future,positive
ksqhVcNkVRG6vKocF1MObQ,i was able to dine in and upped my rating by 1 star i would say 35 star in honesty i'm not in love but they certainly do better for dinner than when i had a to go for lunchwe tried the tako su salmon tartare and the sushi sashimi for two the tako su was soso i love octopus and think that the thinly sliced octopus was nicely prepared yet the sauce was off putting to me the same with the salmon tartare the sauce was way too overpowering for the dish and because there was nothing except grated up salmon and tobiko the texture got old fast it really reminded me of cat food i tried really hard to like it but it was my last favorite tartare everthe sushi sashimi for two only came with 1 choice of soup or salad which is weird because it's a dinner for two it is a pretty good deal and could feed 3 or so people there is a good amount of your basic fish in nigiri and sashimi style plus a tuna roll and dragon rolloverall i still think it's an average sushi place i didn't love the sushi nor hate it the service was really nice though we received complimentary dessert which makes this place really unique i may come back again because it's down the road from me,positive
TunmRrfZb7bt53T6HJi4UQ,love this place  staff are always super friendly and the service is a this is my goto spot for sushi and the lunch special is a steal  you won't be let down,positive
MolFYRyUmfetIp3qydvQzA,solid kimchi ramen  excellent kimchi better kimchi than i've had in nyc in the past 5 years looking forward to trying the regular ramen next time i'm in town noodles were fine pork was wellseasoned pretty good marinated egg the egg and broth were my favorite partsagedashi tofu was good the broth especially tofu itself was ok had a nice server who was new only minor suggestion is that she brought out the check rather soon when i was still finishing my drink and clearly not ready to leave plus it was not busy at all and over half the tables were open not a big deal and i didn't exactly feel rushed but i probably would have had another drink otherwise,positive
2ukJ2tNmtWfHvpGjYMgVnA,i really really love this sushi restaurant it has always been so good and fresh every time i've eaten there the service has been very good as well definitely always going to come back here,positive
gExn3d0VMMJWlSICsGHGfg,our new favorite sushi place in reno we have already been 3 times in a month we have not found a one thing on the menu we did not like i have also never been a fan of dessert sushi but this place does it right the service was speedy and super friendly they were always coming by to ask if we needed anything even when they were busy the building is fairly big and a decent amount of seatingthis is the place to go,positive
o5DMQMa45xWM3mZqTVmsuw,i went here on a friday afternoon after lunch and before dinner the food and service were great the sushi was yummy and came quickly the sake was delicious and the kpop videos were great dinner entertainment i'll be come back,positive
EVmCBFlY0Hy_62bDRizmGA,i was invited to this wonderful place this week for an early dinner to my surprise the food was excellent  they have a monday to friday special from 500pm to 700pm with a specific menu that all the sushi rolls on that menu are only 300 each  the waitress was very knowledgeable of there menu and even gave us great recommendations on what to order  this place gets an a for food  service for sure,positive
TunmRrfZb7bt53T6HJi4UQ,this place is great super delicious rolls and byob makes it really affordable too the staff is great at getting you everything you need without feeling intrusive we went as a group but also saw people on dates and family outings too the villanova roll specifically was a group favorite of ours you really can't go wrong so order a bunch of stuff and try it out,positive
H2c5e7PfcCg9f9Ew19-xRw,dined in for sushi dinner most of their business seems to be takeoutdelivery but they do have 34 tables for indoor dining the staff was super friendly and the sushi was excellent at very reasonable prices my friend and i split several sushi rolls  all were delicious be aware that the place is very casual  we ate our sushi on paper plates and drank the wine we brought from solo cups all fine by us though because we weren't looking for anything more than that will definitely eat here again and would recommend to anyone,positive
OLNr2Tp_vU2U0CX2VGSScQ,super meal  favorite app of all five was the tuna tartar tower  least favorite app was the overcooked calamari  enjoyed many excellent rolls though i appreciate when they are smaller slices so they're easier to eat with grace  all four mixed drinks at the table including the grey goose martini were very weak  that's unusual for a straight vodka martini without a mixer  we'll stick to wine next time  great dinner nice space adequate service,positive
Eyrley48rlyqxdq_wSBKHg,far and away my favorite chinesejapanese restaurant of all time  i've been going there since before they had their fireinduced remodel and i'll always come backthe food is inexpensive the staff is courteousthey even remember us and the food comes out quickly after you orderi'd even be willing to buy a franchise from them if they did that sort of thing,positive

_c72muPOhnfUqLRBNIAAcQ,best unique sushi i've eaten in the st louis area very unique atmosphere the avocado roll was nothing special but man the spicy asparagus  cream cheese roll was amazing my only request would be to add more vegetarian noodle options to the menu service was prompt and staff was helpful i will definitely be back,positive
KQgCflC8eqJU5kvJkByXzw,i unfortunately don't live in an area with a lot of ramen options so anytime i travel to a big city i do a quick search to see if there are any good ramen spots so i can get my ramen fix in i found this spot on my trusted yelp app and quickly placed an order for delivery since i had kiddos with me who were tired lol the ramen arrived within the expected time and was packaged wonderfully so that the broth was able to be poured over the noodles after they arrived this led to the noodles being a perfect texture instead of being overlooked for the ramen itself i went with the chicken ramen and the chicken was incredibly tender and flavorful the ramen overall was very tasty and completely satisfied my craving,positive
gqmQA9TIdmKz3tCnz6DqFA,this sushi was one of the best in tampa that ive ever had im from brandon and drive all the way to south tampa just to get some fresh sushi here i love this place so much especially the traditional kimonos and its definitely a plus that the owner is japanese herself yokosan is the sweetest person who converses with all the customers i love the service and the experience overall,positive

6_T2xzR74JqGCTPefAD8Tw,slightly overrated on yelp good food and good sushi nothing memorable though one of those iron chef restaurants simply because he was an iron chef but maybe not as spectacular now because they've ridden the coat tails for so long worth the one time trip nonetheless but then move on haven't been back in 5 years,positive
8Vo6LN9gqULhXzoxj5k6kQ,great family style dinner  we ordered several dishes all of which were delicious and shared them around the table  i will definitely go back next time i'm in town,positive

AvT60oEgrncToOSrETmkLg,hello hidden gem i recently moved to hampton terracea district in seminole heights and slowly i'm discovering the amazing restaurants and bars in the area although i grew up in old seminole heights i was off growing up when the area was busy blowing upin the best possible way i had a craving for sushi and searched for a place nearby that i could gowelcome to old heights bistro the small space is intimate and inviting the staff is welcoming and knowledgable and the cook he knows what he's doing i ordered a seaweed salad and a spicy tuna rollmy usual order at a sushi restaurant the seaweed salad came with the chef's special sauce of soy and stuff as the waiter explained the special sauce was delicious i would bathe in that sauce the spicy tuna roll was get this spicy one of the biggest problems i have with loving spicy tuna rolls is finding a spicy roll this roll made my nose runperfect the waiter also paired my meal with a light wheat beer perfect for lunch and a recommendation from him overall i loved every moment of this lunch and i plan to come back again after telling everyone i know to check this place out,positive
dqvu-_sIZw7bx0DLX0vC9A,i've driven past this place probably 5000 times and never noticed it it sits behind another restaurant which is a mexican restaurant if you're driving down speedway you'll never even know this place is there and that's too bad kampai sushi is as good as any sushi restaurant i've ever been to the fish is fresh and delicious i just got back to tucson from san diego there is an absolutely wonderful sushi restaurant there with incredibly good sushi kampai is every bit as good if not better i told the sushi chef at kampai i wanted the 15 piece sashimi combination chef's choice but i told him i was tired of the same old fish one always gets when one orders the chef's choice i've had enough salmon and himachi to last for a year or two so the chef chose the fish for me some of which i don't think i'd ever seen before one of the fish was spanish mackerel which i have seen and eaten before the fish was fileted and then its body including its head and tail was curled into a circle held that way by a toothpick and served as a holder for the pieces of fish that were cut from it i actually took a picture of it the presentation was so incredible after i had eaten everything the chef then took the mackerel's body off my plate deep fried it and told me to eat everything including the head i did and i'm going to be going back again and again and again just for the spanish mackerel we had a couple of rolls too don't miss the steveo roll i highly recommend kampai sushi and i'll be going back there often i've been a serious regular at sachiko sushi for probably 10 years i absolutely love it at sachiko and i'm proud to call one of their chef's michio my friend but i'm afraid kampai may give sachiko a run for the money,positive
6Y61FisC5lEVxLEaMzyUUQ,not impressed the location and size of this restaurant are promising i love sushi and i'm not picky a friend and i went on a rainy sunday and the restaurant was not empty but didn't appear busy the wait for our drinks and the sushi was ridiculous the server told us as soon as we ordered it was 45 min wait for the sushi sitting right by the sushi bar i was confused the chef was hardworking but did not appear to feel the pressure of a 45 minute wait for 3 rolls the table next to us was just as hungry and annoyed the server did nothing friendly to apologize or compensate for the wait by the time we got our food we boxed it and left because i was so ready to leave if there is a wait don't seat tables let customers know before you put in the order it might defer customers but honesty is the best policyi will not be back,negative
dUctvEfHQccW_uxtRup2QQ,the prices listed online through google were listed way cheaper the business would not honor these prices and charged me way more ordered take out sushi was warm but still not bad for taste,negative
wexGsdw5Wz85-hOBx9r2Tg,ikkyu was not my favorite japanese restaurant in tucson  the positive yelp reviews were the reason i decided to grab dinner there  i was in the mood for soup but opted not to get the ramen which is served only on fridays and saturdays it's made with chicken broth and i'm simply not a fan of chicken and so that ruled it out for me  it does look delicious in the photos but i wish there was a description of the the different kinds  tonight i ordered a cup of the miso soup which was not impressive  i love miso soup and have never been let down by miso at any restaurant but tonight was a first  i also ordered the bento box and that was enjoyable  the seaweed salad was delicious  i had the teriyaki beef as my main dish in my bento it was tasty but not nearly as flavorful as the beef dish my dining companion had i would recommend getting a bento box if you want a nice portion of food for a nice price  i will certainly head back to ikkyu again  i've got it planned what i will be ordering on future visits,negative
LcoSh7HlJXsev0zujoFApQ,first time and last time going the cashier was a little sassy but was still nice just a little unprofessional once i got my food i was given the wrong order so i decided to let the cashier know and ask for the correct one the cashier said okay and told the cooks after i went back and sat down an argument began between the cashier and one of the cooks i'm not sure if it became physical but it was unprofessional i never got my food even after the argument settled so i had to go and ask again and the cook was a little annoyed the total wait time for my food was about an hour i don't plan on returning,negative
5uPdoWQNjYkrpRmy9AonSw,went here with a group of friends the other night to get some decent sushi the service was awesome the sushi chef was attentive and polite the free noodle salad was refreshing to start off the meal however everything went downhill from therethis was by far the grossest poorly made sushi i've ever eaten the sushi was not fresh and the tuna was clearly left out long and was sour the tamago was awful and i couldn't finish my roll the salmon was chunky and rough the rice was falling a part with each bite  on top of that my friends check was incorrect they wrote the wrong price and refused to change itdo not go food poisoning central,negative
g5FQBX5KZQ3yypFIqzrQdw,i am going to give two stars instead of one to kabuki because i liked the atmosphere of the restaurant and the bathrooms were very coolhusband and i stopped on a busy saturday afternoon good luck finding parking everyone and had lunch  when we walked in they asked us hibachi or sushi  i guess you sit in separate sections for whichever you pick it was okay enough i got gyoza dumplings and two rolls  an avocado crab and an eel  the eel was not fresh at all it was way too fishy for me  hubs had a chicken tempura lunch box which came with some california roll miso soup and more gyoza  the soup was very bland as were the vegetables and chicken that came in the tempura  we weren't too crazy about it in the first place but after we got home we felt the full impact  we both had such bad upset stomachs and indigestion that we weren't able to eat until lunch the next day  i repeated the sushi and gyoza all night  and yes it was worse the second time around,negative
lsO4nMqeEPIT5QZ9jQ9G5g,poor service waitress very rude the waitress followed me to the counter where you pay and stood next to me waiting for a tip after the transaction was done,negative
YMOCOlONOae4zaiKImTnTQ,so i've been to this place a few times in the past and the service has always been slow but the food was really great but not this time this time not only was the service terrible the food wasn't even all the great it was not even all that busy too service was so bad though they didn't even refill my water even after i asked them if i could get a refill did i mentioned that they even walked passed us a few times they also forgot a couple of our rolls i don't see myself coming back to this place anymore,negative
flhHo9x8PwupnxH-QfX1Zg,not impressed if you are into sashimi or fish not hidden within fanciful rolls covered in sauces and other distractions then head elsewhere service was fine decor and atmosphere was fine my plates were sticky as if not fully washed from a previous guest  not okay especially when dealing with raw fish soy sauce was the saltiest i have ever had prices were not good for what i ordered  which was sushi and sashimi only no rolls you could do better at a number of other restaurants nearby,negative
FXUvbpIGhs1uUwzhu9kXPw,we live close to osaki but had never tried it until tonight we usually go to ninja for reasonably priced sushi and hibachi where we have consistently decent food and service we wanted to give osaki a try based on all of the positive yelp reviews and the fact that it is about two miles closer to our house than ninja what a mistake we ordered appetizers hibachi meals and sushi rolls for a table of 4 soup and salad that came with the hibachi meals were delivered togetheri have never had soup and salad delivered together i ate the soup first so it wouldn't get cold it was okay nothing special same for the saladstandard fare with ginger dressing nothing special or all that bad after getting the soup and salad that came with our meals we did not receive another visit to our table by any staff for one hour this is not an exaggeration after waiting for one hour for the additional parts of our meal the waiter did not bring out the appetizers we ordered instead he served two steak hibachi meals that had obviously spent the better part of the prior 20 minutes sitting in the kitchen waiting to be picked up the steak hibachi meals were both close to room temperature the steak was overcooked despite being ordered medium rare when i reminded the waiter that we ordered appetizers he asked what we ordered i told him to forget the appetizers my son and wife ordered sushi rolls and they said that the rolls were above average at one point while we were eating we needed water my wife actually got up from the table and asked a waiter to bring water to us around 10 minutes later 2 glasses of water were delivered another 5 minutes later another 2 glasses showed up when the waiter came to pick up the check i asked to see the manager the waiter told me that he wasn't sure when the manager would be available and that i would have to wait i told the waiter that we had waited long enough for one night i also told the waiter that we had a very bad experience at the restaurant he simply said i'm sorry and walked away to process my credit card it was clear from looking around the restaurant at the other tables that many other customers were having a similarly miserable experience with their meals i have never posted a negative review on yelp and i probably would not have written this review if the manager ever came around to understand what was happening and to offer some explanation he apparently did not care  we will not be giving osaki another try back to ninja,negative
OChSrnaj5tQ1-wm7zoVT4w,i'm sorry to say but had very bad experience last night reserved for 11 people at 8 pmwe came early because we know it's a new years all you can eat dinner so i thought that will packed and it wasbut we got seated at 9 pm because they let people party of 2 or 4 ahead of us even the walk in what's the point of reserve thenat last we starve to death lolthe kids were crying out loud ok we separate table far far away in the corner well family new years dinner ruin alreadyok the food after they seated us the first food came 35 minutes and it's not completely servethey said we can't order until we finish what we had ok we grilled the meat we eat fast because we are family and starving and it's getting latewe order again and again took another 30 minutes to get itand i have to talk to the manager about it smhthey time per person 90 minutes so how come all you can eat dinner 90 minutes per table and the way your service is overrated and then when we ask the server for our 3rd serving after 1 hour waiting she said let me see if you still have time for more what i just don't get itsorry to say i won't be back there's alot of place togo in the citysuburb or china townkorean resto for grill bbq that taste better and fast serve,negative
27TyycLr6a5ju7ROXAtbbA,this is one of the few restaurants in this area that offer delivery so one night i ordered i have eaten in the restaurant before and it was an on ok experience  with fresh sushi and is the only reason why i am giving it two stars and not one the delivery left a lot to be desired i ordered a red dragon roll and it came with a few tiny slivers of avocado it almost looked like someone had picked at it very disappointing,negative
TjXbh5PwgCOFkvbi0_qrmA,ninja was always a go to sushi place for me until last night our regular rolls are the rainbow roll miama roll and firefighter roll the sushi on all the rolls was really warm as if it had been sitting out all day and the smoked salmon on the miami roll was so tough and acidic i had to spit it outwhen the waiter asked how were doing we informed him that we thought everything tasted a little off than usual and we were unable to eat the miami roll due to the taste he asked if we would like another but we were grossed out by the last so we declinedi understand every place has a off night but the reason why i will no longer be going to ninja is due to the management when our waiter who was nice and very helpful told the manager of the issue she seemed offended that we said something she told him she knew it was fresh and we didn't know what we were talking about the roll was only 6 so i didn't care about paying for it but the manager wouldn't even allow the waiter to take it off the bill nor did she come to our table and apologize the 5 times she walked by the waiter who was also surprised management wouldn't take it off the bill had to apologize for themso ninja who we usually fight for and recommend to multiple people have just lost 2 dedicated customers due to management,negative
KTsB7DO-kXVcy23Ds7_PFA,i was craving fujiyama tonight but my daughter doesn't like going and eating on the hibachi side so i compromised with her and decided to eat in the other side little did i know that was a mistake we arrived at 715 and checked in and after an hour i checked on our seating and was told it would be 5 more minutes because even though we checked in to sit on the nonhibachi side they were waiting to seat us for hibachi so we got that straighten out only to sit in nonhibachi side for and hour and receive no food except soup or salad meanwhile tables that came in after us were receiving food the whole time so i decided to ask about our food to find out they had just now started cooking our food after an hour of sitting there the excuse was that the hibachi side was so busy  so basically to sum it up if you sit on the nonhibachi side you are an after thought and only get food cooked when the chef isn't cooking on hibachi side needless to say we will not be returning to fujiyama again,negative
EqxVp4_9Up1HNgpU2pH3WQ,honestly just drive 30 minutes and go to ichicoro tampaeverything this place is trying to be and more my spicy chicken ramen tasted like watered down broth with way too much spice in it everything must've been sitting in a pot for hours cause the egg mushrooms and chicken were fucking drowning and my chopsticks weren't gonna help em the slightest pressure chopped everything in half the miso soup was that of something again cooked hours before lacking flavor and viscosity wouldn't go back if i were you don't get ramen and stick to their rice bowls,negative
gHwjEvz_Q53vPG1RqKbqTA,unfortunately this benihana location has significantly deteriorated the food quality and portions have changed tremendously the atmosphere is less then desirable anymore we have been going to this location for over 30years for christmas eve as well as birthday dinners and it's sad to say we won't be continuing our tradition,negative
r6dvcGaTEcvN4nUIeS15nA,i'll start by saying that this is my first negative review of a restaurant i like to give people the benefit of any doubts but this experience left no doubt i do not recommend this place food quality was okay but not particularly good service was sloooow however my major disappointment was their incorrect communication regarding the menu and pricing the waitress never told us that the menu they had given us was for the buffet option we thought we were ordering à la cartthe menu listed price per piece which turned out to be the price per piece of uneaten sushi seriously that was not clear at the time of ordering in so i asked the waitress is this the price per piece and she said yes i said all right then i would like six pieces of salmon sushi and six pieces of salmon sashimi my daughters ordered as well with same understanding two of us received our food within 10 minutes but the third plate took 15 minutes the plates were small servings were small we finished her food asked for the bill and it was nearly 80 i flagged down the waitress and asked her to explain the bill they have charged us 22 each for the all you can eat buffet after several minutes of a very confusing conversation that bordered on rudeness they finally agreed to redo the bill à la cart style the bill that came back was only 10 less than the first bill70 is way too expensive for the small amount of food we received believe me i'm not kidding about the small amount of food the food was served on small plates clearly they should've made a larger adjustment to the bill and reduce the price considerably due to the confusion related to how they explained the menu additionally they should've been more polite talking to us about confusion related to their poor explanation  overall a very disappointing experience and i do not recommend this place,negative
VhBW615VRkiQLP03oAZ59Q,please do not go here the sushi is terrible like cardboard   and management is completely the worst when i sent it back after not eating it she wouldn't even take it off the check i didn't even eat it it was not up to my expectations terrible customer service gabriella needs to be fired,negative

B9CVx4rmxwPUpprLOVAcdw,wow i cannot believe how expensive this i just paid close to 90 and got one appetizer 8 pieces of nigiri and a rollin addition to the very high cost the food is not fresh and it takes over an hour to servewe have been to dine in and also have gotten take out and this was our experience both times we gave it a second chance because the first time we went was during 3rd friday and we thought it was just backed up apparently not i love safety harbor and wanted to love this place but it's just a ripoff i think and i am guessing being the only sushi place in the small town is a huge contributor,negative
aDgughL1vDootnXe5kUWGQ,i had low expectations for ramen in nashville but was still disappointed with my meal i ordered the tennessee tonkotsu through their online menu to order pickup which was easy and convenient but overall i felt that given the prices the portions were a little small and the taste was not up to par with other ramen restaurants the broth was too salty and not especially flavorful the egg also did not have much flavor finally the pork confit was really just a sort of fried bbq meat but i'm not sure i agree with the idea to add it to ramen where it just becomes soggy mediocre bbq,negative
tfBfrVrZwX6OlB_oZqkwkg,this place used to be the  place to be great music great drinks and half priced sushi man oh man has that changed sushi quality and the drinks  are pathetic  you are better off with gas station sushi the music sucks very sad to see a place that used to be packed with people has empty tables they should have never changed that asian manager he made that place what it was,negative
dUctvEfHQccW_uxtRup2QQ,my food was extremely salty to a point where i took no more than 3 bites and called it quits luckily my child's portion was okay i notified the waitress and the management but they did nothing to make up for my unsatisfying experience i believe this was my last visit to this place would not recommend this place at all,negative
LmZWlvPJBwj5WG2KHV-v1Q,if i could give less than 1 star i would we had a gift certificate that expired 2 days before and the manager wouldn't accept it so buyer beware if you give gift certificates from sushi garden the hostesses could not have been less interested in smiling and  greeting the waiter forgot 1 of our teas and i wrote my roll down and he still got it wrong but our bright spot was the valet guy was awesome i would give him 5 stars,negative

kghdH11lSymYhvAsvljGKw,craving fish in channelside we decided to give oishi a try  the interior looked promising with a dark modern decor and a hibachi grill in the back we tried a few rolls and the seaweed salad  the salad was tasty with a nice balance of salt and acid  i was disappointed with the sushi rice it was mushy and signaled to me that they were not using fresh rice so it led me to question to the quality of the fish as well  there are way too many sushi places in tampa for me to come back,negative

dJfkfBbJz7wi0RgW-ph_Eg,we've been visiting sake house fairly regularly since they opened the sushi was initially very good and the employees friendly the quality of both and the size of the rolls has steadily decreased now the sushi is average at best which is disappointing since the adjoining restaurant cdb's has some of the best pizza in tampaservice is the real downer here have had two instances with legitimately purchased coupons restaurantcom and groupon in which they have either completely refused to honor it or cut their menu options in half when using the grouponunfortunately we have another coupon that we already purchased but i'm not sure we'll be back there's better sushi less than half a mile away so don't bother,negative
VKgK7Z0WR9YIxtAAC63eUA,this place sucks it was my birthday and my wife make a reservation for 20 people she talks to the manager and the day of the reservation they said that we never make it even that we show the business card of him so fuck them,negative

QYPornWtiB1k0xS3Fm-jwA,working in a restaurant myself i understand the struggles of covid 19 while running a restaurant but this evening i was very very disappointed in kobe i have been coming to kobe since i was a little kid not to sound like those people and have always enjoyed myself and have continued to come back for almost 20 years my boyfriend has never been to a restaurant like this before and was very excited to bring him to my favorite for his first time today i called kobe and made a reservation for 2 people at 8 pm we arrived almost 15 minutes before our reservation and checked in we were given a device that let us know when our table would be ready there was multiple parties ahead of us and in the 30 minutes we waited we only saw 1 group of people sat we stood in the hallway outside the restaurant with 4 other couples we were never told a approx time to when the table would be ready after 30 minutes we went back in to the host desk to see multiple staff members standing around talking and laughing we told the host desk we weren't going to wait any longer and they looked at us almost chuckled and said ok very unprofessional for a more upscale restaurant we walked away without anyone trying to be apologetic or try to accommodate our wait very disappointed in kobe and won't be back for a long long time,negative
oeGv2lfbSMfwZ0x7jvOQdQ,so after trying to give this place a second chancethey had an ultimate fail  my wife spent nearly half an hour placing over a 60 order online trusting that the site was safethey never received the order or had any record of this order  their site also asked for her credit card info to be entered into the comments section of the  order  that is utterly ridiculous  she was going to pay cash  so after waiting another 15 minutes for a confirmation email she finally called them  again they had nothing were rude and wanted her to give the entire order over againshe did not have it written down as she picked out each item from the online menu  now here we sit at nearly 9pmno food no dinner no real options as she has gluten intolerances  i hope i love mr sushi reads this so they know that they ruined our dinner and our eveningas we have to find something to eatwhich means i now have to cookand have to get up very early in the morning  they will never get another order from usbut i suppose they never even received the last order either  fwiwthe first time was pretty good second time was horrible  the squid salad orders were half full and the rolls were haphazardly thrown togetherit looked like a child had made our order  this is the thanks we get for trying to give them another chancenever againi hate mr sushi  and i am still hungry,negative

OChSrnaj5tQ1-wm7zoVT4w,i just want to make this review to hopefully enlighten the people in charge of this gyu kaku location i went here on sunday night to celebrate a birthday we got the meat lovers package halfway through the meal our table top cooker turned off we think okay whatever it happens our server will just get us a new one however it happens again and then again and then again a total of 4 times now our server is obviously busy with our tables so our meats are constantly sitting on the stove cooking for 20 seconds and then the machine turns off on us at that point as we're waiting for our server who is nowhere to be found our the meat now is rubbery cold and unappetizing we ask for new meat to make up for that and our server said she can't do that this continuously happens and just decide that this is really aggravating and want to leave without finishing the meat lovers package all we had left was s'mores the manager says she can only take off for the s'mores even though we were not compensated for the meat we didn't get to eat that was now wasted and the terrible experience we personally had so we paid the bill for a meal that left us annoyed ruined our celebrating and left hungry this is a lesson for restaurants to not cheap out on at least putting an effort in amending the situation there was no sorts of the assistant manager trying to make the situation right even after they acknowledge there was definitely something wrong with the machine the least that could've been done was to replace the soggy meat we had my whole thing is that the whole point of this place is to cook your own food so when that is broken then the whole trip is pointless i've been going to this location for years and the service just has absolutely plummeted and i am never one to usually complain at restaurant in fact this was my first time the only thing the manager did was take off for the s'mores that we didn't geteat anyway because we said we wanted to just get our bill and leave as soon as possibleps this is not a complaint against the server she was great it's a complaint against management and how poorly they fixed the situation,negative
n4GDJsQAyBrcWduMjcJ-4g,will never be back the most disrespectful place i have been my group of four asked for a booth and was informed  there was none available  a party comes in after us was immediately sat at a booth we asked why and the young lady talked in a foreign language and she speaks perfectly good english because i have interactions with her prior  this time they we smiling like it was a big secret between them and did not speak english after i asked them to just rude i am a paying customer like everyone else  will never be back and i am going to tell everyone what horrible treatment i received,negative
MJ9FaB4y2jCyn1CU7Fnj2Q,meh a truly uninspiring japanese restaurant their koi pond covered in fencing and chains truly sums it up their wait staff was rude they tried to seat us with another party and resented it when we asked to sit by ourselves i'm sorry but i didn't want to spend my anniversary next to some loud obese family the food was weak and tasteless and practically cold not a fan and i won't be coming back,negative
A5sXEcVHYnmNDs0bwb7u-w,this place has to be the absolute worst japanesesushi restaurant i've ever been to in my life the server couldn't understand how to take an order to save her life every roll has the same ingredients the restaurant it tiny no sashimi no ponzu nothing i'd advise to drive past this place if you saw it advise don't do it,negative
dJfkfBbJz7wi0RgW-ph_Eg,i went to have dinner with my friend and 2 young kids when a menu doesn't specialized in an specific stytle of food u can tell the place sucks the first look is a kind of bar vibe with those high tables and stools but once you take a look we saw theres restaurant style so we got a table we had the waitress went to take our drink order 4 times cause we werent convinced if we were gonna stay the waitress smelled like she just had a cigarette basically she smelled like an ashtray nobody could stand the smell i smoke but this was unbearable my friends menu had a huge piece of food just smashed to it we didn't even order horrible experience when being a server costumers look at you you are the first impression of the place she made us loose our appetite we are aware of smells and presentation clean yourself ,negative

2ukJ2tNmtWfHvpGjYMgVnA,my wife and i went to origami sushi last night  we had been there once before about 4 months ago  apparently the menu has changedwe were extremely disappointed in the menu  it was almost entirely rollswe had a combination of negiri and sushi on our last visit  there were no combinations like that offered anymore  we settled for miso soup and then a 32 piece sushi combination plate  it was four pieces of eight different sushi rolls  the menu did not allow for substitutions  some of the rolls were fine but the majority were jjust average  it looked as though a novice made the rollswe ended up taking about a third home  we actually threw it out the next daythe service was ok  the ambience of the restaurant was very nicewhen we arrived at the restaurant at about 8 pm on saturday night the place was almost completely empty  that should have been the telltale signi don't think that either of us want to return again,negative
VhBW615VRkiQLP03oAZ59Q,so we have been here a few times and never had a bad experience for the hibachi  i am surprised at myself for not reviewing them sooner but as my first review in probably 56 visits i am upset at the fact that it won't be what they deserve which is a 5 star an therefore i gave a 2 because of past experiences otherwise this experience was a 0 if possible but i expect better from this place this last visit was probably the worst experience i've had at a japanese steakhouse we made reservations for a party of 7 we were on time as we know they will not seat you unless you have your entire group with which is understandable because of the show the cooks put on all of us had been here numerous times together and loved it so came back we started with our order of drinks which was simple my fatherinlaw does not like ice in his drinks so we ordered 3 crown and club sodas which came with a bunch of ice but they quickly fixed it our chef  aldo  i will never sit at a table with him as the chef again as he was very unfriendly he started good with his greeting but he made the rest of our night miserable communicating as he didn't ask us if wanted anything or made any other sort of communication as other cooks there normally do he just kept on cooking with a couple shows like the fire in onions which is always cool but he messed up the egg on his hat and missed which again is understandable but the biggest issue was 6 out of 7 of us didn't even finish our food let alone take it to go and that's because we found the chicken and the rice undercooked the only reason the 7th did is because they ordered sushi it maybe a while before i am back but hope i can update this properly then,negative
_0QZGrg91aaiMhh7tQyYYg,i met some coworkers at jackson's after a 5k charity run to wish one of my friends good luck at her new job while i was finishing my salad we were forced to get up from the table so that they could turn the dining room into a nightclub then because i was in running clothes the manager literally tried to have me removed from the room i still had a drink from dinner in my hands we had just spent over 2000 on dinner outside the window of the dining room on the porch were gogo dancers in bikinis dancing on the tables i was asked to leave because i was in shorts and tennis shoes this place is far from the upscale dining venue they pretend to be don't waste your money,negative
skX8LBrX5U45JoF07ykbJQ,this is supposed to be the shrimp roll with mayo and cucumber there is no mayo and hardly any shrimp i've been here a handful of times since the opening and this is sad probably will not considering i drive 45 minutes just to come here poor experience to say the server had zero experience my friend had to send our food back because the server did not tell them chef no white fish we explained no white fish three times the beginning of our dinner the server was rushing us to order  and by the time we were ready to leave it took even longer to get the bill thanks but no thanks,negative
YXaCcpETNtxrNNK6TbUTlw,i'm giving this a one star because i'm super sad i loved this place great broth and great ramen i liked this one the most especially because they use the correct ramen style noodles not like other places in town it's normally not too skinny and not too thick i ordered for takeout last night and was super bummed because they gave me some pho like noodle for their ramen which did not go well with the dish at all if they changed their noodles to the skinny non egg noodle it's not worth eating the ramen here might as well go to nikka in goleta if you want skinny noodle ramen,negative
y1bpqyV8Kr2JaJintHdvCw,this place sucks very unprofessional one time  they charged my card 3 times and the person on charge was very rude the lady working as cashier did not know anything our order took forever to arrive worst experience ever don't waste your money,negative
v9fwMJAcZFbJwigOFoXImg,i have been patronizing the restaurant for about 10 years i have unfortunately seen a steady decline in there portions of food my steak  chicken combination dinner went from 8 something with taxes to 998 with taxes and the portions get less so sorry to say i must part side's do not get me wrong their food is good i just don't want more rice than the portions of meats i was a custom too,negative
X9e_btDPux6JGqqw8UF_Pg,i would rate this place a one but the saving grace was their staff this restaurant is dark you can't even see exactly what you're eating so that was weird the tables are covered in butcher paper which was fun for my kids to draw on but otherwise it was quite tacky we were also served food on styrofoam plates soup came in styrofoam and drinks were in styrofoam there wasn't even silverware which is ridiculous my family and i try to be conscious of the environment so we felt pretty terrible eating off of things that can't even be recycled the sushi was gross and we had to choke it down since you'll be charged for any leftover sushi the staff also comes back a ton which i guess is okay but they would ask if we wanted to order more while we still had 3 rolls to finish the staff was friendly so that's the only reason i am giving two stars everything else was awful and we will not return,negative
2DBo3WFKwpbtl9kJzuroIg,it's pricey for the quality of food the sashimi in the chirashi was fresh but they were sliced too thin overall the portions were large but only for the filler ie rice and salad the seaweed salad was huge and wished there was less sauce on it  in contrast the gyoza was nice and crispy the volcano roll was good but really pricey for that roll that sized it was 1095fyi the rolls comes with salad on the side,negative
OChSrnaj5tQ1-wm7zoVT4w,went there for all you can eat bbq and had a sake martini to be honest i really want to give it one star all of their meat taste like marinated in with same korean bbq sauce many of the option in ayce is not available sake martini taste like 01 oz of cheap sake plus 05 oz of cheap dry vermouth and tons of water since the service is not that bad i think 2 star is good enough for this experience,negative
pe5ZkiVbgg4GmzPjZ999Lg,i don't know about the reviews here but based on my personal experience i will be hesitant to recommend anyone about a yr ago one night my friend and i were craving for asian food so we decided to give this restaurant a try bad decision cause we were having the food to go we took the to go menu from their counter and ordered from it the teriyaki lunch box was somewhere around 14 but when we paid for it the cashierboss insisted it's 1895 and said the togo menu is no good anymorewth you put a big stack on the counter the food was below ok they gave you a box of rice a box of chicken and soup and eggroll i can't remember and that costs almost 19 dollars i wouldn't be so mad if the food was good and certainly hope they have improved the food qualityand corrected the price since my last visit,negative
_c72muPOhnfUqLRBNIAAcQ,came here because i had time to kill i love sushi and saw a happy hour which i thought would equal a windisappointed to find out that the happy hour only applies to parties not hungry people by themselvesfood has spice levels of 3 and 4 that i ordered and they were bland glad i only bought two overpriced rollsservice was solid but overall no thanks never again,negative
KBPKl-40hmRZ6vQeWl7pvw,we've enjoyed all the food we got from teriyaki madness but their app is horrendous we've ordered twice from the app1st time they left off half the order which of course we didn't realize until we got home and it took us multiple calls to get a refund now the 2nd time was even a worse experience our order was supposed to be ready at 602pm my girls ask 3 times for the food but they kept saying your order is in the works and they finally got the order at 642pm when i finally called oh suddenly the order had been ready for a while ridiculous food is now cold crab rangoons are soggy grrrrrrrrr,negative
OHhnQl0JCH6ApyivewNOcA,super disappointed in the food sushi and service i ordered to go and the staff seemed reluctant to serve me as they were about to close in an hour menu on their website is out of date so the items i wanted to order weren't available the deep fried california roll was super bland no sauce was included on top i can say the same about the shrimp tempura roll though i was promised tempura sauce would be on top it wasn't another in my party ordered the crunchy spicy tuna roll and ended up throwing most of it away perhaps i ordered the wrong sushi but i will not be returning to this place sure it was cheap 24 for 3 rolls and an appetizer but not worth it,negative
m6Q6z3SAkXVdidNqiKmBrQ,service was bad i didn't feel like it was the wait staffs fault it seemed like bad training no hostess to seat me i stood there for about 5min waiting to be seated another party behind me left after waiting 2min i said probably a good choice i've been waiting for 5 min the bartender heard me and asked if i wanted to sit at the bar he seemed nice but i never received water and i waited about 10 more min for my order than i think i should have when i got my food my warm salad came at the same time as the rest of my food why make two trips right my sashimi was warm it still smelled and tasted good but waiting a long time for warm sushi makes me wonder how long it sat there im giving two stars for the food if it wasn't warm i would have given four stars i'm giving one star to the bartender and no stars to the manager whom i never saw nor the hostess,negative
mYLrscwJfSJIlEyN57Lh6w,i have an allergy to gluten and was told by the staff 2 times that the soy sauce given to me was gluten free and that all the soy sauce in restaurant was gluten free  10 minutes after i finished eating the table next to me who also had a gluten issue received both regular soy sauce and gluten free soy sauce  the gluten free soy sauce was clearly marked with a rubber band around the bottle  i was sick for 2 days  when i called to speak with a manager and explained the situation so hopefully it does not happen to someone else she rudely told me the entire staff knew the difference between the  soy sauces  clearly that is not true i replied and she told me our waitress is new and still in training  no apologies just rudeness  i will not be going back,negative
6bmVsTncY7MzLlbraU4aTg,we made a reservation at 615 arrived 5 minutes late seated an hour late hostess was very rude served me a beer past its expiration date the beer costs more at the bar for some reason forgot to bring one person's salad the order the food was cooked in made the vegetables cold the band was so loud we couldn't hear each other,negative
ppqy2ZngsnYbp9e3qXGz-w,very rude just came to pick up my sushi and they acted like i was bothering them even though it was empty food was terrible,negative
ixAWNAUrA7JjwvMJzJgxmw,kokopelli's has a lot of things going for it unfortunately none of those things is sushi  of my two rolls one tasted as if they had substituted rebar for the tempura shrimp inside and the other fell apart almost immediately  my waiter also forgot my edamame which was a blessing because at 425 yes that's right 425 for edamame it's neither worth the price or thewellprice  they do offer kirin in the tall bottle hence the second star,negative
vg5nkkwchEPASXDSQsNHwg,the sushi is so plain i don't like it there unless you are getting hibatchi don't go,negative
_bqwjNXAW_Li6c8suIwdBg,we came to this restaurant on a recommendation by a friend who spoke very highly of the place unfortunately we did not have the same experience the waiter would ignore our orders we would only receive half of them when they did come and we were lucky enough to get a special roll with hair woven into the rice since we like shooters so much we decided to try them after our meal and found out that we would only get half of the ones we ordered because the waiter thought we couldn't finish it despite the fact that we had left nothing on our plates not even a grain of rice,negative
I-23nT_0H9lEW8qFHLQ1pA,always go here love the service love the food this review is a special shout out to the man answering the phones today i live close enough you could throw a water balloon and hit my house they have a strict 20 delivery fee okay yes i get it i was just ordering for myself today so it wasn't a lot as i'm inching my way adding things to get to 20 i make to 19 i assure the man i'm going to tip the driver well can i add that dollar to his tip he says no and i was not about to add a 3 soda so i opted for a pick up i was just exhausted from work which is no big deal i've never gone to or looked around for another sushi place but now i think i may religious customer lost for 1 mistake,negative
DJFxBTBIgYErzKS5cA_LiQ,been here twice both times did not impress sushi and drinks were decent however the unprofessionalism and lack of customer service made the overall experience poor as an employee at a restaurant it's important to treat guests with a level of respect in all spectrums most importantly the bubble with employees arguing in close proximity as well being rushed and ignored it all just made the experience uncomfortable the service would be understanding if it was busy but with equal amount of guests and employees there is no excuse for poor service hope the experience is better for others however will be taking my money elsewhere,negative
LdXB3D3gl3ckxZutLmen1g,this place used to be so good but now they have changed places and it's not that good anymore the servers aren't as happy and i could tell they don't really know what they're doing they also skimp out on giving you fish miso hungry used to be so generous and after they moved places it sucks,negative
b6_HDIygAfbG9SZWbZMD_g,wow how does a place go from a 5 star rating to a 1 star rating from the 1st trip to the next by 1 misplacing my order that i had placed the day before 2 not answering the phone number that they posted on the door to call to have curbside pickup so you don't have to wait in the cold after my 4th attempt at calling and it ringing the first 3 rang and rang no not call waiting cause couple other times i called it gave a busy signal someone finally answered only to find out my food isn't ready cause my order disappeared greatly disappointed in the service was trying to support local but maybe they got greedy and overbooked so i'm left with no dinner plans now and you have a line of people waiting outside in the cold i hope there's a reasonable excuse,negative
lZ44dxn1TCzJaVBa8Ze8DQ,good sushi horrible service we had a reservation for 715 on friday night and arrived at 725 when we walked in we were ignored and when we tried to get our table they just brushed us aside we waited 15 more minutes and then asked again for our table and they still brushed us aside and told us to wait we had time sensitive plans after our dinner so we were getting impatient after finally waiting 30 minutes after our reservation we were seated disappointed because the sushi was great but our experience was tainted by the horrible service,negative
qNxVCnU7uAEWl1uK50ONqg,we ordered take out before and thought this place was really good however my bf and i went to dine in and the service was awful it took forever to get refills on our water 15 minutes,negative
qMrWq1CimcZlE02mIBH9SQ,the waiters was good they asked questions and brought out the food and drinks quickly that's where the good review ends the food was very bad the chicken tasted raw and chewy all the beef and wagyu tasted like cheap  beef that i could get at kroger if you want to go there for drinks you should if you're going for the food just stay away way too expensive for no quality,negative
KBUrZtRmVEm2-N4t9hsnbw,the food my husband had was good  i never got my food i ordered chef choice on sushi and nigiri but it never arrived our waitress never came back to follow drink or check on us we had to flag another waitress down she sent our waitress back and she said no sushi i mean come on i didn't even have a plate in front of me 2other tables came in and ordered sushi along with a lot of orders to go  service is lacking for sure never did get my food husband had to go to register and ask for his bill hell at this point they should have said we are sorry  they did tell us to have a nice night‍,negative
F0n-lzB9vqRLdH5Ihcs1Ag,this is the first and last time i will get sushi here i wanted to try something new and dinner is 20 which is a deal but it is not worth it the sushi is alright i had a couple of rolls and they were not the best the rice kept falling apart i don't like how there are no appetizers included i would rather pay 2530 for dinner at another sushi restaurant,negative
VKgK7Z0WR9YIxtAAC63eUA,it pains me to do so but i have to give a lessthanstellar review for sp2  i have been here quite a few times and it's gotten progressively worse each time  very much like being in a bad relationshipyou keep giving them another chance hoping it will get better but deep in your heart you know that it's probably just time to call it quits lately it seems the service has been going downhill i shouldn't have to hunt my server down to get a refill on my water then hunt him down again be unable to find him and have to ask a different server for our checki'll probably go back one more time after i've given it a while but there are far too many sushi joints in reno and sparks to relegate myself to this type of service,negative
HpLIHgoz3XPTyol5tKKb_w,no complaints with the food but the front wait staff is terrible we made reservations well in advance and still had to wait 35 minutes just to be seated this is unacceptable especially with 2 young children under the age of 6 after two inquiries about the wait we were angrily told by the hostess that it is typical to wait at least 30 minutes even with a reservation not too sure what the point of a reservation was  it was another 50 minutes before our chef came out thankfully the waiter wing was very friendly and our chef marco was entertaining as well,negative
v2tctxDffyuHiNGSfb4Umw,my family and i have eaten here twice and love the super tasty sushi and sashimi the decor is trendy and modern and they have great miso soup and edamame our server the first visit was very friendly and knowledgable but on the second visit our waiter just seemed to be going through the motions the appetizers are pretty soso as good as the sushi is about 15 hours after both our meals one person not the same one each time thankfully got sick and nauseous after we ate here seeing that this happened after both visits i can't see going back a third time and when i mentioned this to a friend who lives locally she told me that the restaurant is under new ownership and she had five friends who got sick after eating there in recent months,negative
SwJLqp3ngTotqd3kAmPdyw,didn't even make it to our meal was going to go with friends to eat until i got there and saw the hallway and dirty bathroom food was in boxes on the floors gross,negative
oGxDifAJKGMLFXSmLAaZDg,horrible service we left before we even had a chance to order the servers didn't even make eye contact with us when we came in then after we were seated they were more interested in bs'ing at the register than taking our order this is the worst service we've ever had at a sushi restaurant we won't be back,negative
OChSrnaj5tQ1-wm7zoVT4w,great atmosphere a perfect place for a date my food was as flavorful as an average bbq i didn't expect much because gyu kaku is a chain my service was okay to say the most i can tell the young man was new and he made a few rookie mistakes1 if a costumer finds hair in their salmon appetizer and was understandable about it they should be rewarded2 always check on your table after the food is served to see if everything came out ok3 grab the empty plates costumers appreciate the attention and the clean table4 don't ever ever ever ever talk to the customer while you are walking away it's unprofessional and rude,negative
eltuhV8KTDIhqdYgAyknAw,ordered black garlic ramen and gyoza from here last night and i have to say it was not good at all i was so disappointed i was hoping we'd have a great place to have ramen in the area giving 2 stars because the gyoza was actually ok,negative
DKyJMM2209QrTgclzoCUpw,we waited an hour for our sushi we got there at 615 and didn't leave till 745 we were disappointed we've been wanting to try cafe mochi for awhile,negative
VhBW615VRkiQLP03oAZ59Q,without a doubt the worst all you could eat experience in sushi i have ever seen i love how they present a full menu to you but only one and a half pages of it is for the lunch sushi everything else you could buy separately why don't you just make a lunch menu and save everybody the confusion i knew i was in trouble when almost 80 of all the rolls had cream cheese in them the cheapest filler you could think of to steal peoples money complete waste of time and money i would never recommend this place,negative
GO_skt70UblyW4gYss2-EQ,how do i say this oh thats right overrated the only thing this place excels at is great service with an atmosphere to match this is of course a good thing and difficult for an restaurant to  implement however it does not take away from the fact the food is just not that good i have certainly had better sushi and other asian cuisines go here for happy hour not food,negative
vXQLdqB-stL2JTP5AsPVaA,i enjoyed the food but it wasn't mind blowing i didn't appreciate the service in the end either it took almost 45 mins for our food to start arriving and in slow delayed pieces leaving some people waiting up to an hour to receive everything they ordered while others had already been served and even began completing their meals deciding not to let it get cold if i ate here again i'd just order take out in advance,negative
71U7MxQEhwitJOm4CQpRwQ,disappointed our lunch order took nearly an hour and 20 minutes to deliver and we are only 15 miles away also there was no soy sauce ginger utensils or anything with the order which is weird for sushi place  while they were apologetic about the long deliver time but decent food with bad service doesn't make me want to go back there again if they offer delivery it should be reliable fast and include the sides that you would expect from a sushi place not a place i would recommend ordering from if you have a busy schedule,negative
wexGsdw5Wz85-hOBx9r2Tg,expected a lot more since this place had so many good reviews i came here because both google and yelp said they were open for dine in but i learned this was not true you enter the restaurant and order at the counter all food is togo they only have tables outside but since you have no server it's really just takeout when you approach there's a sign that says read the menu before you enter i assumed that was for people who are not dining in they have no menus inside and ask you to go back outside to read the menu it's pretty lousy since it's in the 110's outside this week same with having to eat outside this is june 2021 not 2020 every other restaurant has reopened for dinein except this one if i had known that i would not have picked this place for dinner regarding the food it wasn't terrible but it also wasn't good i got the ikkyu roll and spicy tuna the ikkyu roll was cut into four pieces it's impossible to eat since it's too large for one bite and smaller bites make it fall apart the flavor was ok but kind of bland the squid was a little tough the spicy tuna had a lot of fish but same thing didn't seem that fresh or flavorful my wife got the curry all of our food came out under two minutes which was suspiciously fast i'm guessing it's not actually made to order might explain why it didn't taste freshoverall since they said it was dinein but clearly wasn't along with the the below average food i am giving this place two stars i will probably not return since tucson has so many better options around,negative
AUBQPQ8wftMBbP2Q3Lbn0w,we came here because we were craving some chicken teriyaki and steak from the moment we walked in it felt unwelcoming the waitress was not good at all we asked if they had some miso soup she said no they're all out but then she went and checked and miraculously we had two bowls of miso soup that was good we also ordered some gyoza which were also pretty good everything else sucked our mail was just lukewarm and when we asked her to send it back she said that's weird because it came up and i brought it right out to you so we asked her if they could just nuke it and she did but with an attitude we also had to flag her down to get refills on our drinks i also stated it no vegetables and there were vegetables in my fried rice needless to say we will not be coming back,negative
XZRcvUnWgIGkKm7iCOJgjA,do sushi chef's know the size of a human mouth why make one piece of a roll larger than my mouth just wonderingthe service was great went on a weekend for lunch the lunch special wasn't so special the food was eh but we ate a lot because we were hungrycan't say i would go back i'd rather stay closer in chestnut hill for better tastes and the same price i suggest a complete and total makeover,negative
aDgughL1vDootnXe5kUWGQ,went here on a saturday night and had food poisoning the next day slow service  the ramen tasted rushed and cold disappointing,negative
XDEgMLsnL9u4qPV_bNCZHQ,the first sushi roll was nearly rotten such a stale old fishy taste  and the next roll was gooey through and through quite a mess  the only good roll was rice and shrimp  i won't buy sushi from here again  so much money for such horribly bad sushi,negative
vh6YOciEM3M4zi2FGp-b5Q,does not have ramen only half the menu on here is correct they have sushi and that's it,negative
nsnehrg4TxUbO-6XrcZNFA,this is my second time ordering from here the hibachi dinner is overpriced for what you receive i got home to find my order to be wrong i ordered the steak and chicken hibachi and found it to be only the chicken because they forgot the steak part there was only the small amount of chicken in the meal extremely disappointing for how much i paid for it also couldn't get through on the phone to even have my ordered corrected or refunded,negative
WZm72JqVRfpw2Pu3vag9gw,the menu says the far east wings come with a light delightful yogurt sauce but it's a lie try to beg for some and get laughed at because they won't make it for you all you get is the japanese equivalent of tough titty i guess the rest of the food was fine  i tried a lot of it and even took some togo but what is their claim to fame i haven't found it zen has the best volcano roll origami has the best gyoza and samurai blue has the best crab stick and scallop delight so what makes this place a destination maybe the sirloin negimaki but that's a big maybe for the price dontcha think it's also a fully cooked dish at a sushi place so there must be something here i haven't tried nothing else besides presentation was of honorable mention at all obviously not the service if i return i'll sit at the bar and try to figure out the fivestar reviews this place has gotten no pressure,negative
gydSKYChNcgZmOg6NiU64Q,i was with a party of 7 we got seated in a small room that had the tables too close together when the table next to us needed anything the server shoved her ass into all of our backs over and over again i paid good money to enjoy my meal if i wanted to be rubbed on i would have gone to a strip club buffet when i leaned in she would just take up more room it made my meal considerably less pleasant then after our meal my brother in law watched a member of the kitchen staff leave a bathroom stall and not wash his hands i will never go back,negative

dA1NubF15yiyEoI1Sm_6gQ,this is basically chinese food wrapped up in a pretty bow and charged double but it won me over for a few reasons   we came for my sisters 30th birthday had it not been her choice i most likely wouldnt have come hereeven with reservations we waited close to a half hour for a table when we finally did sit i was impressed with the decor  the location was worth the wait off to the side but still in the action i wish i could remember our servers name because he was so good we were a little difficult but he just rolled along and granted our every wish they have to do an extended spiel before each meal and mix up some sauces like many of these upscale chinese joints the soups and apps are not that great they are fine but you get less food for the price  the entrees were great my daughter who to this point only ate rice and wonton soup decided it was time to try something different thats always best to do when someone else is paying she got the orange chicken and liked it it was a good place for her to try it because the orange chicken is just that no veggies shrooms or anything very simple i got the mongolian beef it was very tasty it looked like it came with green beans but they turned out to be scallions they were good but overpowering not a first date choice fellas unless you want to pull the ripcord other meals looked promising if you get the strip steak make sure you like mushrooms there was an entire smurf villiage on his plate they encourage you to share so dont visit with stingy people i also liked the almond chicken the highlight of the meal had to be the deserts they have something called mini deserts i ordered the banana split and an image of a tiny banana split crossed my mind complete with mini banana and spoon i would pretend i was a giant the reality of the mini desert was that they were tall shot glasses with layered ingredients there was also strawberry cheesecake smores tira mi su  chocolate cake and others all in miniature form as they say it really was just enough a perfect little pallate cleanser after the meal although if i were paying the 2 price would have hurt a little  this is really as close to fine dining that im going to get the small yet tasty portions are a welcome change from the belly busting buffets that i usually bring to their knees the service and ambiance were top noch im not sure who this p f chang character  is but i so happy to have met him,positive
wVykyNJZPyMqxCBpesXRZQ,this is my goto when going out with the family because the price is right and food is great we have been going for years now and the kids always devour everything we get crab rangoon is great and the mongolian beef is one of our goto dishes  on the most recent visit they had a small news years menu and we tried to order strictly from that and everything was great hong kong steak was good and the pineapple dish served in a pineapple was the kids favorite   we typically try to share the food with whoever we bring so we don't have to settle on just one dish,positive
bYowooV3VobVOKi74sMvXg,we called ahead to see if we could do the 2 for 40 deal for pick up the person on the phone was incompetent and said that it was only for dine in anyways we decided to still come in the only reason we wanted carry out is because it was late and getting close to closing time we had just went to the reno aces game and we did not want to have to bring our 1 year old son into the restaurant we also did not want to make someone wait on us right when it was closing because coming from the industry this is very frustrating however when we came in we sat down asked the waiter if we could get our food to go he was more than happy to accommodate and we went on our merry way he gets the 5 stars for being a great server the person on the phone could learn to bend the rules a little bit because this could have all been avoided and we could have been an easy pay check he should not have wasted everyone's time but we still enjoy pf changs and the food was just as good,positive
ytynqOUb3hjKeJfRj5Tshw,wow you must experience this cornucopia of food at least once during a trip to philly its impossible to truly take it in during one visit we made three separate trips and found something new each time desserts meats fish amish all sandwiched together and all seem to make money here dinics roast beef wprovolone was good but a bit dry martins sausage stand we bought home ribs ground beef and stew meat which were a good prices even got an insulated bag from them to get the meats home in good conditionbassetts ice cream had good ice cream and flying monkey bakery had good cupcakes overall great experience well worth a visitit is very busy during lunch time hours 11am2pm so be prepared or come later in the day some stall close earlier tuesday and wednesdays amish mostly you cant walk out of here empty handed,positive

TRxR32_T_7Ly_RW4Ke97fw,i haven't dined in but i've had delivery many times in a nutshell they've got great food pretty quick delivery and good customer service employees are very friendly and my order is always correct when it gets to my homeand it's hot the menu is pretty large and offers something for everyone i appreciate that their hot and sour soup is vegetarian as i don't eat pork the only thing i'd warn against is that a number of certain dishes are marked spicybut if you like spicyhot food like i do you'll be disappointed in the lack of heat several of the dishes i've tried so far are not spicy or hot at all very tasty but not hot,positive
oF3QPsczR9ZiXPK89tdJaA,this has been my family's go to chinese restaurant for almost 8 years now and have been coming here since i was a teenager and couldn't drive i moved to orlando since then and still make the drive to tampa just to eat here we always get the salt  pepper calamari which is mixed in their own five spice of what i believe would be salt pepper cilantro fried garlic and jalapeño everything is fresh and fried perfectly and doesn't have the same textures as togo chinese places there's some things that aren't so great but the dishes that are are definitely worth coming back for they also have a 3 for 20 menu that is perfect for smaller parties who want to try out different dishes which include most of their popular items the service has gotten better throughout the years and the food comes out pretty quick but it's one of those restaurants where you can't come expecting to be catered but know you're stomach will come out happy,positive

kNyphDVYqOMLsx8aAy9ocA,what a nice restaurant i went with 2 of my daughters we started with scallion pancakes and soup dumplings and enjoyed them both i had the  dan dan noodles with pork and it was so tasty i mentioned that i didn't want it really spicy and they cut the heat i would have preferred them spicier my mistake to voice my concern that they would be too spicy one of my daughters had the dan tze mein and the other had general tso chicken they both loved their meal the general tso chicken had big pieces of white meat chicken in such a tasty sauce the staff was so welcoming and the atmosphere was very nice great decor and the bathrooms were so nice is it weird if i post a picture i don't think so try out this great new restaurant,positive

4DTGsmjExLNCOZlXuqXL2g,i have patronized this business on at least three separate occasions the food was phenomenal each time  customer service is awesome they truly want your business because they treat you like that did i say the food was good by far one of the best real roast beef poboys that you would want to eat  it was so good i ate the entire sandwich  it is reasonably priced and it is worth every penny,positive
XHOU9WPIq5SYzCcBnODxEg,amazing place the food was absolutely delicious the service was kind quick and attentive definitely not your typical american chinese but packs amazing genuine flavor for a good price the dumplings were the best i've ever had and the stir fried noodles were bursting with delicious flavor  highly recommend giving it a try you won't be disappointed,positive

0S3TvsmbCeOZ9UitnpRd1A,the food is very good hereand you can spice it up my suggestion is go to the max it will give you a kick but not unbearable one of the must do dishes is the potstickers  they were the bomb staff is very nicechristie was our servershe's good,positive
eOumGNkn14oEJxQ_ksAVLA,couldn't be happier the food and service is excellent and the portions are hugebest chinese food in richboro holland and newtown hands downlove their vegetable lo mein bbq spareribs and general tso's chicken,positive
KdAWjL9MKjpJzEeI902qBA,i really love the food here and my family and i will continue to frequent corner 17 but the service at least per my experiences could use a lot of work the food is typically amazing here the noodles as most people mention are hand made and delicious i either get them stirfried or in the mala noodle bowls the one time i got the beef noodle soup the broth was bland so i'd recommend the mala bowl for more flavor the teriyaki chicken is fantastic the chicken is perfectly flavored the edges are nice and crispy and the bell peppers are perfectly cooked i've stopped ordering teriyaki chicken at all other restaurants because the one here can't be beat    now onto my issues with service my most recent visit here i got the salt and crispy chicken for my little brother who is super picky but usually will eat anything fried he really didn't like it and i am not at all a fan of deep fried foods when our server came by and we hadn't touched the chicken i explained why the server smiled said sorry and walked away then came back to hand us our bill with the salt and crispy chicken still on it look i'm not trying to get free food even the beef noodle soup that i thought lacked flavor i just brought back and tried to fix it with sriracha and salt but the crispy chicken wasn't touched and would've gone to waste because no one in my family would have wanted it so that kinda blew there was another time where i had a mala soup bowl at the restaurant and asked to get the rest togo and found that the styrofoam cup the soup was placed in had spilled all over my car however i called the restaurant and explained the situation and got a new soup which i appreciated i just hope in the future they'll know that styrofoam cups and soup don't go well together    anyway i still highly recommend the place cause the food is bomb and the place is popping even at 900 at night just know that service will be hitandmiss depending on who it is or who you talk to,positive
ytynqOUb3hjKeJfRj5Tshw,this is such an amazing place i was so overwhelmed but in a good way im a huge foodie and wanted to try every place in the terminal its a total day of fun for sure great eats its a must try when in philly,positive
ZKKaP4Lx-dexf4T1aCsBKw,everything is delicious from the dimsum to the main course and cocktails i'm impressed by the way they preserved asian food preparation and flavors 1010 coming back again and recommending not just to friends and family but also to patients in our hospital craving dimsum,positive
9qXZSFq9vPdX4F6kGjXC-g,finally real asianstyle braisedpork pieces in noodles i grew up eating almost identicallycooked pork belly slices by mom on holidays and having it in my hiro ramen was like tasting a slice of home having never been to japan yet i can't say how authentic the ramen was but it fit the bill for a tasty chinesestyle noodle dish in addition to the juicy pork belly with just the prefect amount of fat the broth was also very flavorful i will definitely have this dish again and again,positive
X4kLBCoQeS-x6zVH7fnOvw,four stars for an asian buffet yes but keep in mind the rating is relative to other asian buffets i've been to in the area i was pretty impressed by the options that wok  roll offer as the name implies they offer stir fried wok options and sushi rolls as well they have a decent variety even sticking to pescatarian options they have a lot to offer i tend to gravitate toward the sushi vegetable stir fries dessert and ice cream which they have plenty of the ice cream might i add is great quality and a perfect way to end a meal try topping a scoop with candied peanuts cookies or fruit from the dessert salad bar for a diy sundaethe service is actually very attentive for a buffet we were asked several times if we needed anything and how the food was it's a nice change overall the quality and options are decent for the price you pay keep in mind there are more expensive seafood nights so pick the day according to your food preferences i can definitely see myself coming back and i don't typically say that for buffets,positive
6YloqVQD3UHfdWMihEi1iQ,the pork belly is delicious it was a bit confusing how to eat it but i'm 100 sure there is no wrong way to lick a plate clean the side board with mustard radishes and mushrooms make a number of customizations possible of course you could do what i did and eat the mushrooms alone because they're that good service was warm and friendly but the food did take a bit of time to come out i imagine once they really get going they'll improve the kitchen times definitely a good addition to the neighborhood and to the city,positive
n4qESYw7vHVVTWq4dtKp2w,i love their food especially their crab rangoon their staff is very nice i have eaten there for about four years and have never had a bad meal they have a good system for getting food to you during covid their delivery is also a big help i would rate it a 105 if i could,positive
BWdDR_4lWAE6uloubO0oZw,pretty good buffet in the busy columbus blvd penn's landing area tried it for the 1st time 1st the likes  the sushi was very good and fresh tasting they had duck which i love and loved the dim sum fried catfish and seafood bisque was decent other stuff is average chinese buffet fare now the bad no hibachi or teriyaki bar boo a little pricey 3 peeps with sodas was north of 50 bucks with tip ouch for a dinner that was fare  but for lunch on a sunday a little high for chinese food mob scene in there on a sunday with a shaky clientele ladies don't leave your bag unattended plenty of screaming brats and families that don't care so if you want quiet u will want to pass on this place parking can get very cramped having said all this and all in all i'm going 4 stars it is getting harder and harder to find a decent chinese buffet in philadelphia so i appreciate not having to schlep to the burbs if i want to get my chinee food fix,positive
D3se5JzK_90jCX6i7UqNUg,we wandered here on a cold night after the theater we left warmed welltreated and full almost everything else is commentary but what i will say is that ken shin offers a nice mix of chinese japanese and thai cuisine sufficient options for vegetarians decentsized portions except sushi but what can you do and excellent prices and service for example we had to ask for water twice and the waitress brought us dessert on the house green tea and mango mochi to apologize when's the last time you got an apology for bad service in philly it's not the most imaginative menu but the choice of hot food sushi and appetizers are ideal for a light casual dinner and the price doesn't hurt 35 for dinner for two,positive
TtNHjyaZBjyMrfo30g6oSg,fsp has been on my to do list for a while since the rft constantly talks about themand their spicy dishes  we were in the area and decided to stop by  it was about 30 minutes before close on a saturday  im not sure if the ac was off or broken but it was really warm insidethe door was open and fans were on  the servers first question was do you like spicy  i knew we were at the right place  we got the spicy wonton soup yu shan pork and shredded potatoe special   the pork was by far my favorite  hovering at the line of almost too spicy it mixed really well with the potatoesthey didnt serve us rice  we will definitely be back for more hopefully this time in a cooler setting,positive
ytynqOUb3hjKeJfRj5Tshw,a foodie's paradise a foodie photographer's paradise a person who has a hard time making decisions would drown in this place and i consider that a fantastic thingeven if you're not a foodie go at least once when you have a bit of time so you can peruse through all the shops the experience is unlike any other restaurant market place in phillyi ordered house fried noodles from sang kee but i would recommend getting something a little more novel since you can get the full sang kee experience at their main restaurant a couple of blocks down i'm looking to go back enough times to pick out my favorites from each shop don't worry i'll be sharing it on my yelp reviews,positive
ETjyPeqYHYkd3m0VR2k6uA,pretty good chinese food and fast service i will try back to give a better review,positive
2a6tP2bpH8ga5V5XZVUdtA,traveling through the area and called china gourmet based on yelp reviews for carry out i could tell by the female taking my order that she was experienced in her job and i could hear lots of chinese chatter in the background we ordered steamed dumpling eggroll chicken with snow peas and chicken chow mein everything was excellent could not have been happier you don't realize how good a chinese restaurant can be until you have to live with a horrible local chinese i liked this place so much that i called back to complement them on how good everything was,positive
V6mqd8fC6-y_KKsfJTQyIA,love this place good fast service and fresh food i had the house lo mein and my husband had the orange chicken both dishes were a 10 if you are traveling south through green valley try panda house,positive
PrRZhBIzflSYeNd8LTllOA,friendly fast service good solid chinese american food  the kind you hope for when you're in the mood for lomein noodles with jumbo shrimp general tso's chicken beef  broccoli or the other traditional take out goto's they even threw in a little steamed broccoli as a garnish on the side of the chicken disha nice touch both healthy and colorful the dumplings were a little thick on the starch but that's coming from a picky expat nyer the flavor was good overall excellent quality for the price,positive
gMbsb4mAs8gkVVOcq0MmCg,wouldn't call it taiwanese or a tea house exactly perhaps more panasian although the young husband and wife duo are starting their business venture off right in the food industry but to shine you've got to debut some new and exciting disheswhen it's cold outside i have a craving for spicy noodles and wonton if you've seen kung fu panda it reminds me of po and his father's famous noodle restaurant from looking at the diners consisting mostly of blackhaired and various chinese dialect speaking customers  it's gotta be half decent whether you think it's good or not you be the judge the menu is small and there's many things i would skip over such as orange chicken general tso and sesame pork heck how can people eat that stuff then again you'd probably ask the same if i ordered something disguised in a fancy name to make it sound more appetizing it's ok none of the weird stuff here just plain comfort food recommendationssuper spicy wonton noodle  delicious szechuanlike style hot chili pepper and garlic oil mixture portion a bit small and heavy nonkissable garlic breath afterwards dating nonominced pork noodle comes with a house soup dan dan noodlelike not as chewy lovely dressed and seasoned minced pork with tiny tofu cubes in savory sauce topped with diced chives and julienned cucumbers to cool the spiciness coconut green milk tea with boba  good thirst quencher like venti sized for 325definitely a little gem in this town with potential zai jian see you again,positive
A9rVxmIBtHZRvNhbBaGAWg,very tasty sichuan place near trenton their specialty is sichuan style fried softshell crab it comes to the table wrapped in foil along with veggies and herbs underneath the foil is some wax or other material that they light on fire with a lighter to finish it off so it is at peak taste when the foil is pulled back and the amazing aromas greet you and then when you bite in deep the taste is full and juicy,positive
KdAWjL9MKjpJzEeI902qBA,undoubtedly the best chinese food in st louis an asian friend of mine recommended this place and trust me it rocks we tried the asian pancakes as appetizers and the dragon eggplant is to die for really cool ambience and you can watch the whole process of making noodles the little one was fascinated and could stop talking about it for days we're definitely coming back for more,positive
mPEntpEgMVCvRdlRUGf8DA,absolutely delicious the best sushi i've had in a long time service is quick and great even on a sunday the place was busy would recommend to everyone give them a try i'm sure you won't be disappointed,positive

sKDqswbR_bwxLueSOHqqNA,this place is awesome real deal szechuan so glad its here worth fighting the traffic on 70,positive
Yu401DtSmkXpJhgXnQcFrg,it was a super hot july 4th weekend and we were in town walking around getting hungry looking for yummy food we stumbled upon this dimsum location based off of yelp at that time we walked in it was dark kinda dreary for a dimsum place although it was packed in a claustrophobic way there wasn't much energyexcitementliveliness whatever we were seated at a table that barely fit the 6 of us and we aren't that big either way elbows were touching and i felt like i had to eat in a cubby hole the food was yummy though and cheap surprisingly so but we were just hot from the weather and uncomfortable form the seating that we didnt eat much a good overall place for dimsum,positive
a3k17xVeU38IlhsyKpz5zQ,excellent customer service staff are courteous and friendly restroom is super clean dining area is well organized and clean foods are warm and good will be back soon,positive

jZGqAdBlDnrP-J7--vdPxA,love the speedy delivery service i am pretty much guaranteed to be fed in 20 minutes of course i timed it so i call right before the lunch hour rush my coworkers do beijing at least once a week and take advantage of this service on a hot and humid day a rainy day or a super busy day at workalso in the summertime if you have a sit down dinner before 6pm you get a free appetizer or soup,positive
iMw_LReFjEsvhFGrU1EKqQ,omg  im still thinking about the food from last night  i had been meaning to check this place out for a long time but the early closing hrs kept it from being an easy destination    i had heard the accurate reputation of the divey atmosphere and maybe it was better than i had heard  perhaps it didn't smell much since it is december  the place seemed reasonably clean and the service quick and friendly  the food was the best chinese ive had in ages  i felt like it was a higher quality product than the other greasy over salty usuals in my experience  the salt baked wings seemed obvious thanks to the mob mentality here  they were really good and im not really a wings person  one friend with me asked for a specific order of just black mushrooms  she seemed to think we should get chicken or tofu with it but he said no i'll pay extra for just a plate of them an damn they were wonderful  all 6 dishes there were 5 of us were really really good  another stand out was the garlic chicken eggplant dish  it was our only rice dish and the flavor was incredible  another first for me was the needle noodles which i hadn't expected would be so good  we ate every bit of food on the plates and paid a healthy tip  it came to just 11 each person  ps we brought a couple bottles of wine and the server brought additional styrofoam cups out immediately after seeing that,positive
uzfhgIbhEjr1cEUNHoQZ1Q,i am finally getting to writing a review for chef chan's i have been coming here for a few years now when i am in the mood for good chinese i usually get takeout have ordered multiple different items and never been disappointed recently i received a large order for several people and it was packaged really well and everyone enjoyed their meals my goto's are the pan fried chicken dumplings hot and sour soup pork fried rice and general tsoas tofu amazing the eatin dining always looks nice and is usually full of folks the owner is also really kind,positive
BoEcsaokOWStr04tQqr24A,went there for a late lunch today we ordered off the chinese lunch menu i had the crispy chicken and my husband had the kung pao chicken both were excellent i asked for the spice to be moderated in my dish and it was just rightservice was very attentive we lacked for nothingdinging lotus inn one star because my cocktail was very poorly made nonetheless we had had a stressful morning and the lotus inn gave us great food and comforting service,positive
QMtgL_S41EDvwtRjj7EbPg,i like the crab rangoons and my favorite is the general tsos chicken too lol chicken tastes like chicken fried rice is good and service is prompt,positive
D0fanJRjGeSveHiBoWbpeQ,phenomenal hot pot  last time i had hot pot was in singapore and i've been looking for a place here in the northeast   we took our family of four and loved every aspect of this familyowned restaurant the service was spectacular and the food was mouthwatering   the sauce bar topped it off,positive
PC62l488ujL8i75jrBiOlg,blue giant has really delicious chinese food it is a little pricey but it is definitely worth it we ordered it for takeout and you do have to call a few times but you will eventually get through what we ordered shrimp wontons so spicy they were delicious but really hot so if spicy is you're thing you'll love them my boyfriend loves spice and is obsessed egg drop soup so tasty and flavorful it was a great way to start the meal hot and sour soup my boyfriend ordered this and really enjoyed it blue crab rangoons i don't usually like blue crab rangoons but these were the best ones i've ever had you could actually taste the crab in every bite fried rice the fried rice was delicious and if spicy isn't your thing this is a great option for you duck lo mein i love the duck lo mein i've ordered it twice it was delicious and flavorful without being overly greasy and making you feel gross after mala crawfish noodles this was delicious was incredible but also really spicy so be warned my boyfriend really really loved it though they also do their own fortunes in their fortune cookies and they're funny,positive
_V6hl1oGkTV2KbGeax_HPA,located in the reading terminal food market this establishment has been tucked in between other vendors for 40 years a solid pecking duck to say the very least the sauce that he drenches the duck and rice in is very light yet has a powerful impact to the overall taste of the bowl the broccoli was a little overcooked in my opinion but the duck was superb,positive
T9C1od-JorSPXwXgzSqM9Q,obsessed with their fried shrimp veggie lo mein veggie dumplings and they have a full bar open late perfect place to eat after hours server could be nicer,positive
qscWQ0p98jQWT-GIEOJM7Q,for chinese takeout there is no better place in south jersey  the owner sonny does take the time to talk to you and at least remember you the next time you stop by and you will stop by again  stop by here about two to three times a month and have not had a bad meal yet,positive
zi0gBCtnESAbVKRNYHrKog,one of best asian buffet restaurants in the area since covid they changed how food is served we don't take the scoops and get our own food anymore you point to what you want and they put it onto your plate which is fine by me,positive
PLn7sTtwMxnSBrSg0t1VAg,solid 4 stars much thanks to the other yelpers made my decision to order much easier free parking on the side which makes it so much better especially where the restaurant is located 50 on dinein or pickups onlyfor delivery full priced menu,positive
zxPcNvM4aPZu6gUmTFkazQ,i was very surprised with wok chithe order taker went over the menu with us to make sure we understood the format it was pretty self explanatory you make your bowl and wait for it to be brought out the portions were great for the price the beef was seasoned perfectly and the vegetables were great brown and white rice are free but there's an upcharge for friedthe restaurant was clean and the decor was nice looking forward to a trip back soon,positive
GKohndn_sMk2nWCh1jkAfg,i love places that do chinese  japanese and this place doesn't disappoint the first time we ate there we dined in an the food presentation was amazing  very unexpected based on the decor since then we've only gotten takeout but the food has always been wonderful from fried rice to sushi luckily i live close enough to walk ,positive
aqbwtK_JFkuoODbISEzYzw,i've been here a few times and always had a great experience for what it is it's pretty much your average chinese place but they're very quick and efficienttoday i was in a rush and ordered a lunch special on the fly from the time that i paid until my order was ready was six minutes and 30 seconds i don't care what you say that's fast,positive
AGlh4ZDv6jnoiYfz7At9mw,no change in the number of stars for this place but i felt the need to update my opinion of the food aside from the tasty soup dumplings they have a new menu item called pan fried juicy pork buns which are awesome they're not really supposed to be a panfried version of a soup dumpling so don't expect that they have a thicker chewier skin hence the word bun rather than dumpling in the name and are quite delicious their handmade noodles are pretty decent as well though not as al dente as i would prefer the noodles with pork sauce weren't bad but still don't come close to the ones at nan zhou,positive
5C5v40wpZMYKBFvRJFD_pg,i gave 5 stars due to the facts of fast  friendly service good tasting food and a lot of food for the price i had a lunch special that came with soup chow mien and fried rice the main dish was kung pow scallops and was very good the menu is large so there is definitely something you can find here,positive
wYYsmF6begc6ZcnPGwF9NQ,i am forever ruined never again will i be able to eat at another chinese restaurant without comparing it to jun dynasty i've been here for both lunch and dinner the lunch specials are fantastic for 79 dollars you receive an entree fried or steamed rice an egg roll and a cup of egg drop or hot and sour soup dinner portions are larger and it's almost a guarantee that you'll have enough to take home for a midnight snack or lunch for the next day i've also had trouble finding dumpling that parallel the ones i had in asia a few years ago and i finally found them here the ones cooked in chili are my absolute favoritethe flavor can't be beat and the wait staff is friendly and attentive,positive
JzQsy7_G0p-UZGYFMCEHvQ,had a great experience having dim sum here my friend and i came on a saturday right when they opened and we got very fast service the parking lot fills up quickly so definitely try to get here early our favorite dishes were the steamed bbq pork buns and the sesame balls,positive
XCY5mYQv-6Y-uOZEOgOhiQ,first time here in almost a year and it's still my favorite sushi spot in indy you can't beat the 12 price sushi on sunday's you must purchase a drink to get the 12 price this was my first time getting the potstickers highly recommend we got the spicy tuna roll and the dynamite roll the dynamite roll is my new favorite we loved it so much we ended up getting another order i loved the fresh jalapeño that they put under the cream cheese mix adds some nice spice we had good service at the bar and walked out spending less than 50 which we thought was great since we got 2 beers an app and three sushi rolls hope to be back for another date night soon,positive
AGlh4ZDv6jnoiYfz7At9mw,the prices and food at dim sum are great this restaurant is byob and there isn't a corkage fee i highly recommend this restaurant,positive
Qc9r_Vbrx2I4yQmvPIP_0A,i've often seen this place full of people so i came here for dinner with a friend a little while ago it's got an interesting vibe where it was clearly a bar in the past and the owners redecorated part of the place with asian lanterns and misc other things but left the random band posters and wildcat art on the walls as welldecor aside the food was pretty good definitely one of the better chinese spots in tucson i got the mapo tofu and my friend got the beef lo mein the menu says all their noodles are made in house so that's a definite plus the service was quick and the food came out hot and delicious my tofu was spicy but not so spicy that you couldn't eat it but i definitely drank multiple glasses from their giant water cups the prices were reasonable with us each paying about 10 this would be a great place to bring a group order a number of dishes and share family style,positive
Gf3szNlyQWst4v49S-W1lg,this place is super legit it's my family's favorite chinese bakery and we are very experienced with chinese pastries so the interior isn't the most attractive and they don't accept credit cardsbut what do you expect in philadelphia chinatown i can't speak for any of their other products but the important thing to me is that the pastries are the best the egg tarts custard buns pineapple buns coconut pastries etc are all bomb if you buy enough the lady behind the counter will even throw in a good deal for you i'm not in philly often anymore since i live in california but every time i am in philly my family always makes a stop at mks,positive

y9Ujj9047UPGTCdAUu2ICw,i've been going there for years it's not great but it's ok but the other night when i went the dinner wasn't ready yet sunday it starts at 330  but they didn't put it out till 4 o'clock  yet they tried to charge me the dinner price so i got in an argument with them  she called the owner and he said no  it was a difference of six dollars for 2 people apparently he made the waitress pay for it  i gave her 6 bucks to offset it  i'm furious  never going back again   i had an incident with hot tea before also where they tried to charge me when they said it was free  he finally took it off the bill this guy does not know how to run a business  they took off the shrimp off the stir fry grill and put fake seafood on there i'm done,negative
yozjf0JrGUOpLZn4pRCtAw,this location has serious staffing issues tonight i went in and ordered a bowl with veggies and orange chicken the young woman taking orders put it in a container with the flip top lid when i finally got to the cashier she asked if this order was mine and i said yes a bowl etc she said did you ask them to put it on a plate i said no i asked for a bowl and that is what she gave me she said we'll do you still want it i said i don't understand are you going to charge me more she said yes so i told her i wanted to pay for a bowl because that is what i ordered she took the original order threw it away  i and all behind me in line had to wait while she went back and made a bowl such a waste and all because a coworker made an error ridiculous,negative

tXZXimXWvx-jF6UVgjE3Og,this restaurant has awesome chinese food  we have been going there several times per week for at least five years the employees need to improve their english language abilitiesin other words to be able to understand what the customer is saying while placing an order  we had two consecutive nights of our order being incorrectdid they try to make it right with us  yes did they make it right with us no my spouse wanted things this way  and we got things that way  the consecutive orders that were incorrect were not intentional and were only caused by poor english language skills  when an order is placed  requesting an ingredient like greenbell peppers to not be includedthis is a simple request  details are pretty important in this world that we're all a participant in we will not be returning to this restaurantlove the food  somewhat reasonable prices  nice peoplebut i can't waste my time ordering something and then receiving something else  i lived in taiwan for 6 years  so i understand language barriers if you cannot place an order and get what you orderedthen don't order  we won't anymore,negative
XueXnQZ-N4bcdc1ZlroNSw,i've gotta admit its pretty average tasting for your local greasy chinese eatery i wouldn't say its fantastic or anything i have gone here a couple times but its very greasy the prices are very cheap and there's a large menu selection and you get a large portion of food the people who work here are very nice and get your food lightning fast still on a search for that perfect cheap chinese spot for me,negative

gpHpa-Q-6v1TAOPmKbmReg,this chinese food establishment where too begin   the decor outdated  unkept  dirty  needs a thorough cleaning and  disinfecting   the food is laughable and dangerous     i started off with something every restaurant in america claims to be a expert on      chicken wings      how can i get delicious bodega cooked  proper chicken wings   in the hood       yet a well long standing chinese restaurant in berlin nj barely has a edible staple any dive bar can master  then arrives the main event roast pork with mixed vegetables in a soy sauce with pork fried rice and a egg roll   wtf happen vikings conquering parts of europe had better cusine     if you think all chinese restaurants are skilled at preserving and illustrating  exceptional quality food     your sadly mistaken the roast pork was so overcooked and dry it literally had density   slivers of pork should not be able to feellike peanut brittle     the  chinese mixed vegetables were mushy  and  poured  over with some strange abomination of soy sauce gravy the pork fried rice  rice should not remind you of dish soap      it was just  disgusting     overall summary don't waste your money   go too wawa new chinatown restaurant in berlin nj   is pathetic serving that food  for money footnote    the server  older female server chinese woman    customer service and attentiveness is nonchalant  standoffish when interacting with you  and she seems to be preoccupied with not pleasing  your experience and making your feel welcomed   i think her only inspiration for good quality customer service is feasible if  she thinks you might leave a tip   your first encounter eating at that restaurant     be a repeat customer and never complain about the food as long as they can make money off you ,negative
tBO9ttcLUjsQzpCApeWu-g,we've been trying to find a decent chinese place for takeout since we moved to the area  this place has pretty good ratings and a coworker of my wife recommended it  we called and asked if they deliver  they said in very broken english yes but you need to order online  so we did  about 40 minutes after placing the order online we get a phone call from someone with almost zero grasp of the english language but what do you expect from a chinese restaurant  after 5 minutes on the phone with them we were finally able to put together that they were not going to be delivering our order  we would need to come in to pick it up ourselves and we would need to wait another 35 minutes before we should go to pick it up  against my better judgement we agreed to go get it  my wife picks it up and brings home  unpacking the bag we notice half our order is missing  back on the phone i go  more nonspeaking english people handling the phones  my call gets handed off to 3 more people until i get someone who vaguely understands the situation  i explain my displeasure and asked them to send someone to deliver the missing items as we were not going back to pickup  i was told it would be about 40 minutes  at this point i was just like whatever  i didn't really expect someone to show  so we sit down to eat the items that we did receive  this was some of the most bland flavorless chinese food we've ever eaten  as we're finishing up the phone rings more nonenglish  we're finally able to piece together that it was the delivery driver who didn't know the address of where he was supposed to be out delivering to  have you ever tried to give driving directions on the phone to someone who doesn't understand english  ughhh  long story short we'll never be patronizing this establishment ever again,negative
T9C1od-JorSPXwXgzSqM9Q,i order takeout and the food was decent really disappointed to look into my bag after my meal to see that there were no fortune cookies it's the main reason i enjoy chinese food really upset about this,negative
Eo0psaCr_gcty9QqyUy46Q,this place sucks i went there with my family for a nice lunch and let me tell you it was the worst service and food we've ever had first it took them 35 minutes just to seat us we only had 4 people and a little baby second our server kept staring at us like we were aliens he had a terrible attitude and looked annoyed if we asked him for something i ordered the fried rice and an eggroll and they  forgot my eggroll but the rice was dry and disgusting my mom ordered a simple club sandwich and fries and it took them almost 50 minutes to  bring  out the sandwich and the didn't bring her fries they brought her fruit and to add on the bread was as hard as a rock she couldn't even bite down on it we told the manager and she was very friendly a little to friendly  i hated it but you make that decision,negative
EcjHDndSeQuebMMJhCGC5g,why on gods green earth would you go hereit is the worst chinese food in the area and a few minutes away is some of the best chinese food in the region im talking about hunan in ardmore yes ardmore forget chinatown in philly or nyc a former citizen of china a new yorker and a chinese person co signed on this place as one of the best chinese food places in the regionthat means the whole northeast corridor we ordered almost everything and it was all good the owners come up to you at the table and personally greet you the waiters are extremely nice im used to the high arrogance of chinese people at their establishments but these people are phenomenal i know im committing dinning suicide being that i can hardly get a reservation there now and after this little place becomes more known i probably wont be able to get in when i want to but the human desire to share with my fellow human that which is good overrides my best interests and the price is unreal i actually felt like adding twenty dollars to the bill thats how good the food was and how cheap the price was this place cant be realyang ming is disgusting stale ghetto style chinese in the heart of the mainline ghetto if you go there i couldn't understand why,negative
D3se5JzK_90jCX6i7UqNUg,i bought shrimp lo mein there for lunch the portion was very small for the price most chinese takeouts are big portion also the lo mein was not even that good so not going to come back again,negative
bYowooV3VobVOKi74sMvXg,last night 11422 we went for dinner and sadly it was a threeplus hour dumpster fire the pandemic has obviously affected restaurants in reno and they should not be held accountable for short staffing issues understood this usually onpoint restaurant has gone thoroughly downhill it took over an hour to be seated when the dining room had many empty tables actually we were forgotten about and had to remind the hostess we were still waiting after said hour once seated in the bar area although again the dining room had numerous open tables our server stopped by the the table about once every 30 minutes the kitchens' backed up was said before 'thanks for waiting' so our meal took over three hours with empty water glasses and lackluster food instead of 'sorry about the wait let me pick up your drinks or desserthere's the thing we the public get that it's hard to run a restaurant in these times your customers are usually accommodating and sympathetic but you restaurant need to also lean in during these times pf chang's is getting by on past accolades time for a reset management,negative
e7iYOgvyb1D-NkPZDNikQg,the quality of this place has gone way down their food is still hot but lacking flavor and nothing tastes good stay away from their lemon chicken actually just stay away altogether,negative
bYowooV3VobVOKi74sMvXg,curbside delivery was terriblewaited 30 minutes for food and half of the order was cold   second experience same  trying to help out during covid but not worth the bad food and prolonged wait times,negative
dpwkz52tHB2MCPv53I2aRA,avoid this place at all costs worst chinese food quality very poor table and menus were sticky silverware filthy ordered jazmine beef beef drowned in tons of sauce and grisly they make you pay for steamed rice what a rip off waiter nathan provided the worst service i've had in years paid 17 for food i couldn't even eat because it was so disgusting waiter doesn't  check on you or ask how your meal was nothing the fact that i left my entire plate should have given him a clue but was oblivious,negative
Q6eP-wX_xOI0bnZqIQlTGA,its been a while since i have been back here to eat but my daughter wanted to go out to eat and we were in the area so we tried this place again when we entered we were literally the only people dining in the building so i thought it was a little odd so we noticed the buffet had changed a little they got rid of one whole table and replaced it with desserts like little pastries brownies and fruit which was cool but it took away from the dinner items that used to be there so it made the options fewer since we arrived at dinner time they were serving crabs and all types of seafood that me and my daughter don't eat so it kinda sucked we had to pay dinner price when we don't even eat seafood but whatever cause they cant go around watching everyone's plates i guess they'd get ripped off that way charging different prices for each item when it when it comes to the food the food was cold and a lot of the chicken was hard for some reason and tasted disgusting the food selection was different but not in a good way they have a lot of chicken options but no other meats besides that and not too many vegetable options besides some kind of green beans soaked in some sauce and broccoli with the chicken and broccoli that was cold i am trying to eat better but this restaurant definitely didn't help me with that aspect because there wasn't too many healthy options to choose from and i ended up eating like 2 pieces of chicken and that's about it i basically threw money out the window eating here,negative
o82N_gX_Cc0kPzjd-8__ig,i'm just here with my friends the food is good over here but the soft drinks are too much watery they are not so friendly to invite us inside they were in a hurry to take the order i asked suggestion but they didn't help me to choose one from the menu the people here are like a strict officers i will stop here there are lot more i can say they spoiled my mood of eating,negative
HJ9qmwxI5-3YeKRoDbbulA,they do not know the meaning of the word express here ask me to wait only 8 minutes for your teriyaki chicken  do you still want it kinda hard to say no after you swiped my card had me sign for it so i wait and about 15 minutes later they bring me my order and i'm missing an entrée  so i tell the kid tell the manager i'm coming in i go in manager wants to see receipt  i guess he figured after waiting 15 min i wanna wait even more for a free entrée  i told him he can have my receipt but this isn't the first time they screwed up but this is the first time i'm complaining he  says sorry gets me my chicken and i have to ask for teriyaki sauce for the other teriyaki chicken orders i had because they figured not only do i wanna wait damn near 25 minutes but i also like sauce less teriyaki chicken minus an order of chicken only reason i go here is because my kids like the orange chicken if  can get them to dig real chinese food i would never come to another panda slowasswaitspress again,negative
x_b2wweMFSJ3i6SoNtbtDQ,we got a coupon and since i didn't have pf in so long i really wanted to avail it i have had better tasting pf changs their lettuce chicken wrap starter was great and on point however their spicy sichuan beef and chang's chicken the signature dish were small portions and the sweetest spicy mains i have ever had disappointing especially compared to other franchises it will take desperation or an involuntary social gathering to have me dine here just maybe for the apps,negative
D3se5JzK_90jCX6i7UqNUg,i went for lunch in for lunch on a saturday when they were pretty much empty one other table  the waiter came fairly quickly to take our order  unfortunately this was the last thing that happened quicklywhen our food did begin to arrive there was no discernible order to its arrival either by prep time or the desired order of consumption  also the preparation of some items left much to be desired particularly the miso soup which was lukewarm and not very appetizing  when the rolls arrived almost an hour after we ordered they were good but by that point my frustration level made it impossible for me to enjoy them  overall the service leaves a lot to be desired but the food was palatable with a couple of notable exceptions  i probably won't be back since there are other options in the city that i have had better experiences with,negative
dfP7vEVqcgFWmObIInwFzA,the food was pathetic  the sushi rolls were all rice and very very little substance and they 9 seafood salad consisted of very very pieces of dry fish on a bed of lettuce  very disappointed,negative
5XTdTRNeO33_9qHPDDtAag,i've been here before but it's not my first choice for chinese it's close to where i live and that's it's only redeeming point i went tonight after a class i had to take for school it was about 7 pm when i arrived and there was about 5 people in the place eating i don't know what time they close but they were obviously not putting out new food half the food bins were half empty or looked like they had been sitting untouched for awhile my thought is if they're going to charge full price in the evening they should offer the same fresh food they had at lunch andor dinner if this had been the first time i'd eaten there i would never go back,negative
NABcZKRWQF9-rDVt0P0bhw,this is a sad review as i liked ocean city restaurant a few years ago it used to be packed lines out the door and the dim sum food was fresh and decent service now it's like a broken down place we went on a sunday afternoon 12pm and the place had plenty of seats which should've been the 1st red flag well the place on the 1st floor felt like 90 degrees inside like they can't afford ac or something probably one of the hottest restaurants i've been in the service was non existential i kept asking for cold water but nobody came and we ended up never getting any cold waterif the food was good then at least we could give it a few stars but no the food was not good the shrimp i'm told tasted very fishy and warm not even hot the beef ha ga tasted strange and filled with fat and fillers the actual pork and bone dim sum was also very fatty we had a few more but nothing was memorable compared to the 1st time maybe chef changed but it's definitely gone downhill and we won't be back considering there's plenty more great places around lastly it was so hot we ended up eating halfway and going to sang kee i got cold water immediately no asking thank god,negative
GXMXaiQYLOiIM8XUq_-luQ,ordered through seamless earlier this week hunanese style spicy chicken szechuan style spicy tofu veggie lo mein noodles was what we ordered not a single one of the spicy dishes was even remotely spicy bland and tasteless everything lacked salt the only saving grace was the chili sauce we'd requested in the side very disappointed,negative
vG9aD-fvsIimgo-l7u8-AA,our server was nice and the food was delicious unfortunately that's where the positive comments end this particular pf chang's has now been a disappointment twice in overall dining experiencethey seem to be understaffed and although they are friendly as a staff they are very lackadaisical in their energy and very slow in service both visits the bar lacked anyone behind the bar at least 50 of the time we were in the restaurant although we were seated in the dining room it might explain why it took almost 15 minutes to receive my beverage many customers in addition to us seemed to be looking around their empty tables in hopes of food or beverage to arrive soon i have frequented pf chang's dozens of times in many states and this location has been the worst both times i have been there in addition the floors and tables were sticky and the silverware dishes and glasses were spotted,negative
-fciE0b98A43i04VIEDlgw,i order from oriental all the time but recently i've noticed some changes in their food quality and service we ordered one hot braised chicken order for my man and one shrimp for me delivery took forever and when we finally received our order over an hr later it was wrong they sent two chicken orders instead i dont like their chicken because its usually extremely dry rubbery and hard to chew the rice was almost hardened together and stale not what im used to from them you would think it would be an easy problem to fix simply replace the wrong order for the correct one however i called them back about it and they decided the best solution would be to charge me additionally to have the order fixed and redelivered makes no sense to me if the quality of their food was good they way it used to be i wouldnt mind keeping what they sent instead of what i ordered i understand that mistakes happen but handling them appropriately is a skill they dont seem to have i guess,negative
l02ynruMoe4bvrzJ6bA_0g,ordered takeaway staff were friendly and looked to be working hard order was ready timely food was terrible pad thai tasted like it had been burnt or cooked in a pan where something burnt same with second noodle dish spent 35 and pretty much inedible ordered a second dinner from a different place,negative
o7Ccb9LjC_ZTSF_YHgJXnA,i ordered their standard pad thai minus the sprouts  red pepper flakes i customized this order with chicken egg peanuts  cilantro i ordered this to go i went and picked it up a half hour later when i got home my pad thai had chicken noodles two pieces of onion and was way too spicy no peanuts no egg no cilantro i was the only customer in the restaurant when i picked it up what happened,negative

lwJllJ5e4CLHdliOPEfgGg,we entered the restaurant because it's kinda a high rated one they have the typical americanchinese food which is ok we weren't expecting a real chinese food anyway but the service was awfulthat waiter with weird orchid finger certainly had attitude starting from the first beginning when we asked for water instead of any drinks he then turned his back and walked away after after we didn't order the roll with 2 more dollars after awhile he came back asking me do you want to order more so i thought maybe he was too busy i should've give him a chance i was going to order a roll but i don't know what kani means since that's some kind of japanese the waiter stared at me and said you don't know what kani is i said no he said it's fake crab i was not so sure what he meant by fake crab so i was like um fake crab he turned his back and walked away again just left us like that i guess we were despised by a waiter we ended up leaving the restaurant without finishing our meal and that waiter complained like check that quick one star for the tempura appetizer which is good also don't order the crispy duck it got that strong ducky smell,negative
ndz5gn5knfCOdryATgMQVQ,this is the worst place ever customer service is horrible went today and asked to order side of shrimp fried ricethe guy advised me i have to pay more i said why he said cause the prices may change in 7 minutes so he walks away go into this room behind him im standing there he comes back and tell me much more only for a small lunch item i give you 00000 not even a one,negative
838bEDzZSPveDkAGrhVWYQ,stopped here for lunch with a friend and wow this place was packed service is sketchy they know you're trying to get their attention but they're just so busy that it's hard on them you have to see that fact and not get frustrated by it the ladies pushing the dimsum carts are nicer but the choices just weren't all that great sorry i've had better the dumplings were meh that being said we still left full thanks to a surprisingly delicious fried calamari and tasty steamed bok choy glad to have tried this place but i won't be going back,negative
qAiX2FQ40QprVpytMjBwkQ,the food tastes like it does at all panda expresses this one gets 2 stars for being filthy the floor is so sticky when i moved from standing in line if took effort to move my foot the tables and soda counter had food and drink all over them my friend and i had to bus our own table before sitting down the cup lids were still in the packaging on the counter and the forks were all over this place needs to hire someone for cleaning only it was gross i have no intentions of coming back,negative
XwATUlsFWMbKbV4KpfzF6A,worst chinese food ever way too salty and hardly any chicken in my entree will not return,negative
4e0AuvnWvjr2cJEaEdrtxA,it is what it is i can't justify anything more than 2 stars because it's just not a stand out place the food is ok they deliver and the menu is better well bigger than the other 2 chinese spots but there is nothing wow about it  really wish i could give a better review because the drivers have been awesome the couple times we ordered delivery i'm sure it's not always the case but both times we had the food delivered it was at the door within 15 minutes  the food is certainly not bad and i'm not suggesting that you shouldn't eat here just be aware that it's probably not gonna blow your socks off to china,negative
uGHhxLe9sF-R7d13OfAgxw,don't buy here my experience with this place was very unpleasant as part of my order i was delivered an appetizer which was completely sub par they skimped on the ingredients and tried to serve something i doubt they'd ever eat as a result of my dissatisfaction i respectfully requested a refund and even made it known that i'd give the driver a tip and that only a bite of the food had been consumed and i'd return the rest the woman who answered still asked how much did you eatto which i replied a bitei don't like it she suggested that i come to the restaurant to get the delivery refund i declined then she said i'd have to wait for another day i agreed her final reply was for me to never order there againas if she really had to tell me the obvious chinese restaurants are everywhereif you are in this area i would advise you to put your money anywhere but here,negative
UhNeXD7-v7wDZOqxNLgLXA,i ordered online at 1152am confirmed with an email the ticket the server rang in said 1156am the email i received had a delivery time of 1245pm the driver showed up at my door at 115pm i called at 1pm to ensure they did not forget about me and the lady simply had a sorry we were busy answer i live about a 10 minute drive away which is 4 miles from their location i ordered the 3 roll special for lunch and a special roll all rolls were supposed to be spicy but i guess they forgot to add being that they were busy and my 32 delivery order was not important enough this was my first time ordering from here might be my last,negative
5RP9gL2E-rZPet_2jOqp8A,this place is absolutely filthy mold growing on the cooler and roaches not just one multiple roaches i will never ever go back there i am completely disgusted i had to argue with the lady to cancel my order and refund my money,negative
7onZdKip10S3x2R9S1fqwg,if i could give zero stars i would unfortunately you have rate at least one to provide a written review we decided to try this restaurant out based on a mix of reviews that primarily leaned toward the 4star region we were wrong it's now 1230 pm in the afternoon we ate peng yuan's crab rangoon and eggrolls at about 700 pm last night these were the only two items we shared aside from other dishes the symptoms began around 300 am we've been battling symptoms that seem very aligned with food poisoning per all of my internet research in a desperate hope to find relief i have tried to call the restaurant to let them know so that others do not fall ill please do yourself a favor and stay away,negative
VDALc3reT_hkzf-wch2rjQ,the food is not that great i've certainly had much worse chinese though but to be honest when we order chinese we prefer to drive into columbus for pickup as opposed to getting this food deliveredprices are on par with most chinese food staff was friendly food is ready pretty quickly i think they have coupons for small things like a free egg roll will not be a repeat customer though,negative
GZDkhotwnmGlpYUKxAwobw,i'm really disappointed in this place i love boiled seafood and dishes with seafood i really expected more from this place what i experienced was a buffet style service with food that was hot but i definitely would have preferred made to order food with bulk prep like this flavor and food character as well as presentation suffer but the prices certainly didn't,negative
8xAa50YbwlE53F652Ru_Nw,first of all have a sweater or jacket if you plan on eating thereits freezing inside  after we placed our order we asked for a glass of water to drink  they could not would not give us water  we don't drink soda out the door we went  note   the place was empty,negative
7sN7b3Z1Ywge1INmGf6FgA,i'm not really a fan of chinese food but i like pf changs it's  nice fake chinese food and it makes me feel cultured to go here i know i'm a complete loserthe restaurant is clean and the decor is nice a lot of dark wood comfortable booths and a big menu can satisfy the fussiest of palates our waiter was scott i agree with the previous reviewers about the servers speaking from a script we ordered the crispy green beans as an appetizer and they were amazing i know everyone raves about the lettuce wraps but omg the green beans are way underrated imhoi ordered the chicken fried rice and my daughter ordered the lo mein i took one bite of my meal and spit it out it didn't taste right so what did i do i tasted it again i wasn't wrong something was wrong with this foodwhen scott came back and asked if everything was ok i told him my food didn't taste right i was nice about it because i don't mess with people who touch my food the arrogant jerk asked in a cocky tone well what's wrong with it is it overcooked undercooked do you not like it i'm not tasting your food and i can't just take it back to the kitchenso being the b itch i am i told him that the food tasted the way the elephant pen at the zoo smells he rolled his eyes at me but i swear that's how it tasted so he takes it backa couple minutes later rachel the manager comes out and is apologizing profusely she told me they used the wrong sauce on my fried rice the one they used was for a lamb dish she agreed that my food smelled earthy her word not mine  she offered me a new meal and was really sweet about the whole thingscott came back out with the check and was all of a sudden nice again i guess he wanted me to tip him well so he figured i'd forget about his attitude if he flashed his pearly whites the food here is usually consistently good but the servers not so much i think i'll stick with the plymouth meeting chang's if i start jonesing for the green beans againfood 4 stars great vegetarian and gluten free options service usually fast with an attitude this is the place where all the mean kids from school got jobs once they graduated,negative
LAWKzwPItDbwS0_HA5nGzg,i have been coming to china king for years now it had been about a year since there last the experience this time was not the greatest my wife is diabetic  was asking for recommendations on their menu foods that were high in carbs and grains were being recommended my son and i ordered general tso's chicken and it tasted like seafood we dined in and a cold front had moved in well they had a beverage delivery  kept going in and out of the front door one of the gentleman with a cigarette in his mouth the whole time  blew snot out of his nose right in the front entrance as much as i have enjoyed this place over the years i will take my business elsewhere,negative
wYYsmF6begc6ZcnPGwF9NQ,the worst thing ever a business can do is not except cash  this business said will only except credit card over the phone can not pay in person  i unfortunately can not do business with any restaurants that refuse to except cash as payment  it should be up to the customer what form he or she chooses to pay with not the restaurant  really disappointed as this place sounds really good,negative

zU5PPd9j4bYC_MepNSEDcA,the place was overcrowded with no open ventilation and no six feet distancing which is abhorring during the pandemic they didn't ask for proof of vaccination either the service was very slow our one dish didn't arrive until 45 minutes later because the kitchen was backed up short ribs and the chicken were a greasy mess dumplings were average at best,negative
cP81x13w3Mg5PhoaSXdV8A,i've been searching for regular delicious chinese take out  nothing special or exotic  i'm just asking for some good pork fried rice sesame chicken and crab rangoon combo  hong kong failed  the crab rangoons were edible but very sweet and not as delicious as i know they can be  the fried rice was gross  it was flavorless  the peas in it were hard  were they freeze dried  i don't understand how they messed up fried rice  and the sesame chicken was meh  it had too much sweet sauce and just missed that wow factor  the breading was mushy and too bready there was no crunch we will not be ordering from here anymore,negative

G8H-8KnMFjS4bHtTBX9t7A,you know i used to like this buffet and all you can eat sushi style restaurant but since not coming to this place for a while and going tonight it was not satisfying at all and very disappointing the sushi was sitting for a while the food was the same the waitress was ok at first but never came to fill up the drinks i had to shake it or get another waiter to refill it i had gotten the check from another waiter and signed it and gave whoever an ok tip what i think it was worth and before i could get up the waitress grabbed the check book and opened it gave a mad grin didn't say anything in english anymore and started talking in chinese madly to another waiter  so no not enjoyable time here tonight it seems like it's slowly going downhill,negative
n9uQrKjd7Yn35NA3vGRtpw,poor service cold food average 795 buffet with no flavor and overpriced i waited to do my review till i called back to see crab leg stock issuethey were once known for the amazing seafood selection and quality of food as well they stated they carry crab legs went to go for dinner said due to shortage they didn't have any they would give us a cheaper price still high for lack of quality staff seem to rush you when speaking as well i was told to follow up or call to see when they would have crab legs as well i called them and they said we don't carry them at all any more bye and hung up mid sentence didn't ask if i wanted reservation or any thing so out family dinners will be elsewhere the website pivots on crab legs sushi  seafood yet the dinner layout was shallow with long periods of foods being empty and not available it sad to see a restraint who prides themselves on quality and 12 years strong to break down and become nothing but a cheap imitation of what real 5 star place used to bedon't waste your money or time here save your self and your taste buds from bland over priced disappointment,negative

bffLbfi1IEAff5C2IHJvFA,it always pulls at my little foodie heartstrings to go to a place with exceptional expectations and have those expectations absolutely not met especially when i was super duper hungry and spoiling myself with my love of chinese cuisine why you do han dynasty why you do def was not happy about usuing my bonus weight watcher points at this placefirst the service here could have been faster if performed by galapagos tortoises i wish that were not the case but it was and there were quite a few times where i needed something such as a refill of water that did not get done honestly if it is that much trouble at that point please just leave a pitcher at the table becaue the food is super spicy and my mouth was not happy i meani love spicy food i just don't like waiting for water through the searing saucy pain hello i have to say despite this little or big fudgeup in service the food is super delicious we started our dining experience off with the steamed dumplings in the chili oil those little suckers were an addictingly delicious appetizerand i mean can't stop at one and have to fight off the other people ninja style for that last dumpling smothered in every last drop of chili oil good we also got a round of some dan dan noodles which again i will fork my own husband dare he try and sneak one more noodle then equally portioned out we decided to have our main entrees spread out for everyone to try and all of the dishes were bursting with spicy rich and savory flavors my favorite was the lamb swimming in perfectly steamed vegetables with a nice medium hot sauce over their sticky rice i kind of hated that i had to fight against some bones to get all of that marvelous lamb meat but it certainly was worth the minimal amount of effort han dynasty i am willing to forgive and forget if you step up your game in service for now i may partake in your take out so i don't have to be disappointed by your staff but if i should ever sit and eat again make me feel special,negative
LLpaJ-ugo-or9ZQpFDETWw,i don't understand why this place exists  here's a brief checklist of reasons they might consider shutting it down1zero ambiance2zero customer service3zero greeting4zero smile5zero can i help you not even a what do you wanti ask can you make me beef with green beans instead of beef with broccoli  after 3 second blank stare silence  i rephrase the question pointing out they have chicken with string beans and ask again if they can make beef with string beans  couple of seconds pause mr no smiles says we have chicken with string beans  i said i know  can you make me beef with string beans  answer no  hmmmmm what was i thinking  how stupid am icome on folks  customer comes into your empty restaurant at noon and you can't find a way to welcome a new customer you can't find a way to take some of those beans and mix them with beef  must be a joke in that but i don't get it,negative
T7oDsacxvoHdHQmBZOjwuA,someone should teach these people what chinese food should taste like  absolutely no flavor  my moo shoo pork was a combination of dried out and tough meat to which someone added week old bean sprouts gross however nobody cared that i did not like the food you would think that the big fellow who works there or owns the place would want to keep his customers  apparently not,negative
BfmLLzI_bkLRnusFnyK1-w,well if your looking for a place that treats their customers rude this is the place for you i went in to pick up my take out order i placed my order at 515 for 615 i walked in and gave my name and number the women went to look for it she came back and said she didn't have it so she kept looking then began to help other customers then she began busing tables at that point i was sure i was on the show punked after a few more min i asked someone else they went and got her she asked me if i came up with another number i informed her i knew my phone number and this mistake was on their part glad i got out of there without giving them any money,negative
y7WPOc2_vCoBkwK3xPJ8XA,ordered from here online and did not hear anything from the restaurant for over an hour when the order said it would be here in 40 mins i contacted them to see the status and could not get ahold of them so i then contacted the online service i used when they got ahold of the restaurant they said that the driver will not be able to make it to my delivery never communicated this to me,negative
UQZ4p6xb_7gY7UXHmBzceg,although called tom's dim sum only a small portion of its menu deals with the small plate culture of china  the first page offers the expected dumplings shumai and a few cold options but the majority of the kitchen deals with traditional big plate possibilities further everything is ordered from the menu rather than using carts and old ladies to bring all choices to the table for perusal and selection the lack of a floor show is somewhat disappointing more importantly the quality of the food was also less than stellar and consistent we ordered a hot  sour soup crystal shrimp shumai pork buns and crabpork xiao long baosoup dumplings the soup was fine with plenty of mushrooms sprouts and a good vinegar base the crystals were not looked shiny great on the plate but tasted like they had been boiled in heavily salted water hot salty wet shrimp were unpleasant on my tongue and not what was experienced in other houses the pork buns were dry as if they had been sitting around for a while although the ground pork filling was okay the xlb had a decent broth within but seemed sweeter than normal had to bite their top knots off and drop the table dumpling sauce into it to improve the savory flavor there are much better soupies available in chinatown service was fine and the dining room was clean tom's is located on 11th street under the covered portion created by the shopping mall as our server explained when we asked this is not really a dim sum restaurant despite the name as such it suffers from an identity crisis inherent in its business model it offers a glimpse of dim sum without fully committing to the full monty experience,negative
mpeLyxsDTm5RqZkFT--SdQ,ordered a coconut mijito and it was the best drink and only good thing from this visit sushi wasn't that great the sweet and sour chicken tasted like it was in the fridge too long as well as having a plastic after taste we also were served a nasty spoon with food stuck on it i will not return,negative

VdB1YL718sAxae12PGgplw,first time ordering tko and so disappointed we had the egg rolls chicken fat fried rice tko chicken and fried broccoli the egg roll wrappers were very good  great flavor and super crispy the inside just mushy mounds of cabbage and who knows what else  terrible bland flavor the fried broccoli was ok but it's fried and tossed in some kind of mayo sauce  of course it's ok the most disappointing was the tko chicken that tasted like it came out of the frozen aisle at the grocery nothing unique or fresh tasting about the sauce and the fried ricean honestly funky taste that seemed off like i stopped eating it after two bites i hate to sound so sharp in a review and love to give restaurant a second shot but this was borderline inedible i want my 50 back ,negative
AZphL3UZHn_F7tLY8iUw4Q,i ordered 6 chicken wings with lo mein i couldn't believe how tiny the wings were it was totally not worth the money for an adult entree i called to tell the store about this and they said that the sizes vary  i said when they do you should put more in to be fair and reasonable this was the second time this has happened by the way  otherwise it's a good restaurant,negative

NVpbPRDvfwjb85CJwWE0nQ,the importance of reading back an order is keyi am sort of new to the area and was told to try this place out because the food was amazing so today was that day it was a snow day for my husband and i i ordered 2 combination platters sweet and chicken and beef and broccoli plus two orders of dumplings when the total came up i was actually quite shocked at how cheap it was so i thought nothing of it we received our order quickly which shocked me because i'm use to 45 minute wait times my husband opens the bags and asked you didn't order anything i said i ordered beef and broccoli my platter wasn't there so maybe they left it in the store by accident my platter wasn't even on the receipt call back to tell the same person that my order wasn't on the receipt and this person told me i didn't hear that can we make this a credit for next time excuse me absolutely not i ordered this i need to speak with your managernever in my years have i ever blacklisted a restaurant on the first try that experience was awful the only redeeming factor is the delivery driver he was awesome,negative
hIckd162HsqqnyItmOOfNQ,i order from this place quite often but every time i ask for a modification they never do it i asked for the wontons on the side they came in it i also asked for extra scallions didn't get any i asked for my combo to have rice on the side it was in it it also ended up being more expensive on the phone than online but i had an american express card so i had to call it in pretty unhappy with this place it will be the last time i order from here,negative

ajGbu7IlLBjmN9E982k1ww,this is the first time i have ever written a review on yelp that is how bad the food was if this is chinese food chilis is gourmet french cuisine the fried rice is a watered down version of yellow rice not fried rice the general tso chicken and the sesame chicken are the same thing except the sesame chicken has sesame seeds and both  tasted less than mediocre at best the worst by far was the egg drop soup it was just plain awful i honestly think it may have been rotten i threw it away after the first taste i was unbelievably upset with my experience if i hadn't ordered delivery and had the will to drive there i would demand a full refund but i think i am just gonna bite the bullet this time do not ever go here i'm sorry but i rest my case,negative
z1k4Fn6gTZdgx0IfkbvrBw,a very paradoxical dinner experience over priced and under cooked go figure the market bar something or other starts off at 1299 and escalates rapidly as you add a protein into the mix i ended up paying 15 for a plate of highly spicy and overly salted entreesomething i could have done on my own at home the beef was extremely over done while the veggies was drastically under cooked as for the service the sauce selection area was not being refilled on the regular i stood at there for about five minutes waiting for someone to come over so i can tell them about the almost empty sauce container the first lady i talk to walks away the second man that i talk to asks me twice what i needed he finally understands what i'm trying to say he proceeds to take my sauce bowl removes the ladle in the sauce container and dumps the entire leftover contents into my sauce bowl mind you i didn't need that much sauceand this caused for a very overly salted and spicy entree i paid 15 for this dish and at the very least i deserve to have freshly refilled sauce,negative

sUy0wjvMfC8MitrS4uNDIQ,not a fan got the general tso tofu per a review below and i honestly did no like it at all the good called and placed an order it was quick no wait time and no need to put me on hold  order was ready in 10 minutes quick service  plenty of parking in the lot did not have to drive around in circles the bad broccoli was barely steamed at all almost raw not a huge deal but would've liked it to be actually steamed  the tofu not a fan not enough sauce or flavor the flavor is a miss and i've tried general tso tofu all over town  the price for 14 i expected more will not be getting again and probably won't be visiting this establishment again either had to add my perspective because i ordered based on previous reviewer raving about the tofu will be throwing it away,negative
AGlh4ZDv6jnoiYfz7At9mw,if you want to ever get your order never order from herehorrible and rude workers any negative adjective you can think of it would be used to describe this placewe placed an order of four items totaling to 43 and when the food finally came over an hour later we realized we got the wrong order we made a total of 7 calls trying to fix this mistake first we called the restaurant who told us it was the drivers fault and then the driver told us it was the restaurants fault then we called the restaurant again and they told us that we could call grub hub to send a driver and replace and order for the food we did exactly as they said and grub hub told us that they'd give us a call back guess what they never did so we called them and they claimed that grubhub had no drivers so we recalled grubhub and asked what was happening and they said that they sent a driver to the restaurant so once again we called the restaurant and this time they gave us attitude saying what can they do if grubhub would not send an order and pretending that they didnt understand me midway through the call we get a call from grub hub who apologized to us because the restaurant closed in conclusion the restaurant didn't want to fix the mistake that they made because the workers wanted to go home and decided to lie to us if you're a respectable restaurant then they should at least take responsibility and fix the mistake they made not lie to a customerwe waited over two hours for the food and tried to fix the problem don't order here if you expect good customer service and want to get food i wouldn't be surprised about the things they'd do to any customer's food if they annoyed them there's plenty of other good chinese restaurants you can get in chinatown,negative

-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w,first off it is a very crowded area and parking is very difficult  most philadelphians probably know this but coming from nj i compared it to trying to find a parking spot in ny's times squarethe place has that instant you are in italy vibe  we sat at the bar and our guy was amazing in every aspect  unfortunately i didn't get his name but the bill says 'server 1'i had a salumi and cheese pairing which was very good  there were three different cheeses and all were outstanding the meats were just ok  the prosciutto was good but i didn't really care for the bresaola  what really made the dish was the parmesan cheese gelatoyes you read that correctlymy friend had the gnocchi in a red sauce which he thoroughly enjoyed and absolutely loved his cherry vanilla gelato for desserteven though the parking reminded me of nyc the prices were much more reasonable than midtown manhattan,positive

f3sM7oEaTBI_XIa9yBoVjw,looking for a place in the area to eat dinner last night and  decided to give it a try based on the positive yelp reviews excellent from beginning to end the cocktail the fresh bread and olive oil lamb chops marsala and tiramisu were each excellent food was fresh and well prepared service was prompt and attentive i will be back,positive
49v1EM5ao88mJ-d79dwPVQ,everything was great we ate in the restaurant after we got our hair and makeup done for my friends weddings the owner  manager  worker were super nice and very helpful we ate in the restaurant even though it's more of a togo type place such good food and quick which is what we needed thank you,positive

t5Xc0u9yvOH0-DgmrCS60Q,this isn't a very fancy place but the food more than makes up for it  i've been driving there from st charles for yearsbe forewarned their salad portions are definitely way too big  a child's sized salad is usually more than ample for a single adult  if you order provel cheese on the salad be prepared for equal portions of lettuce and cheese  my husband and i actually went back and forth for years on whether their salads come with onions on them  needless to say the onions most of the time come on all sizes of salads,positive
sb8-TzsXOV7IsErbpHZo3g,we have dined here often and it is always delicious  one of my top recommendations is the chefs tasting selection  i mean you simply can't go wrong plus the service is great and their general manager thomas always stops by to say hello and makes sure everything is going well  their weekend dj music makes your hips move to the beat,positive
XqSLir6xs3I6ntf-xIQzrQ,i have to admit i went into city house expecting to be let down so often i go somewhere based on people's sparkling reviews only to be disappointed by unattainable hype city house cleared the bar and stuck the landingwe split a belly ham pizza as an appetizer i almost wasn't going to order a pie i just got back from visiting my mom up north and ate my weight in real pizza and i didn't want to ruin the afterglow but i did and it was so good perfectly cooked perfectly chewycrispy crust cheese was fresh and smooth and the porkooooh the pork mmm melts in your mouth i had the housemade sausage for dinner after much deliberation but i think i would have been equally happy with any choice the motif of the menu is the lovechild between southern american and northern italian and everything sounded good finished off with a divine lemon ricotta pound cake with gelato retooled my conception of how good pound cake can bedrinks were solid i'm enjoying this towns newfound love of lovely cocktails that aren't of the appleblackberrypinktini variety carry onthe vibe was comfortable a welcomed shock to my expectations usually the uber hip places are populated by people who still use the words uber hip and want loud house music pumped in so they don't have to think about their empty shell of an existence city house was bustling in a good way loud with the sounds of happy diners and a busy open kitchen only problem was we were seated in a 25 full dining room at a table between two other parties one of which was a little douchey there was room for spacing but not a huge deal when distracted by deliciousness i'm much more amiable,positive
yEa_sWqLpmB5NbXyAz_g_A,go for the ribs  better than famous dave'stucked into a cozy south philadelphia neighborhood this is a jewel  love the homemade vinaigrette dressing  the menu has good south philly variety but if you like ribs this is the place falling off the bones and a generous portion the prices are great 13 for a 12 rack of ribs    the place is of course packed for dinner on the weekends and pretty crowded for dinner during the week  there's about 20 seats in the dining room so go early to avoid wait or go for lunch 10 for a 12 rack of ribs,positive
yl0yqngQGbW2hPmf5L427g,this place is fun has a restaurant separate from the bar a game room and i can always find something i'm in the mood for the meatball sandwich is great handmade meatballs they had a special that was a stuffed sirloin that was incredible hopefully it comes up again soon waitresses are fun nice and hustle nice work ladies,positive

BWITd9JUXP3gSi1z3Y-z8g,after having such a wonderful experience here my first time around i made my birthday dinner reservations here for a party of 14 i called in advance and although they usually require a prefixe menu for parties of 10 people they were more than happy to accommodate when i asked if we could order off the menu a la carte the food came out quick the service was great and everyone loved the pizza and chicken parm if i could change anything i would have ordered fewer appetizers and more pizzas because with a larger group the apps are so small that not everyone can get an adequate bite mushroom zucchini was a crowd pleaser as expected as was the sausage and peppers in riva never disappoints i love this place,positive

Tz10h4z2J6j2V9gD2fgGKA,probably one of the best italian restaurants in philly what sets la casa di lucia apart is that it's genuine family owned and run restaurant big joe is at the bar keeping the books and playing host with the most lucia is in the kitchen cooking up one of her classic homemade dishes little joe is making taking care of the pizza pies while anna and julie wait on the customers la casa di lucia offers fine italian dinning in a casual setting when you sit down at the table your not just some customer your family,positive
LICbmW9NVcSB6d0ITXvadQ,great sunday brunch options today  i opted for the lunch menu and ordered the grilled trout special with tomatoes and capers over asparagus and polenta  my wife went with an omelette stuffed with mushrooms and cheese  both were outstanding and we were quickly served despite arriving at 1215 on sunday  four stars because the portions were a mite small and the price was a little too much,positive

8P8HIysyyGbG8_94cG1Jyg,i've very much enjoyed my two visits to entree i would suggest making a reservation check out open table as the restaurant is very small and fills up quicklyat entree you can order items individually or take advantage of their prix fixe menus there are both 40 and 50 prix fixe menus with delicious choices of appetizers main courses and a dessert the 40 is absolutely the best bangforyourbuck in my opinionfor apps we ordered the prosciutto wrapped dates from 50 menu the wedge salad and fried calamari both from 40 menu all yummy the dates were very rich so in hindsight we probably we not reorder as an app i got the seared scallops 6 total in a sweet corn hash which was truly delicious 40 menu my dinner mates ordered the brick chicken 40 menu and the halibut special 50 menu which they both enjoyedsince the restaurant is small some of the tables feel like they are on top of each other i had someone leaning into my back the entire dinner and unfortunately there was no where to move our table fun atmosphere but very tight squeezegreat option for a byob if you're into the prix fixe option it's nice to come and know exactly how much you'll be spending,positive

cFoUuE6thjn88cVCTqYBHw,we came here yesterday on a whim we waited a few minutes to be sat which wasn't bad our waitress was a little lackluster at first every time i had a question she'd already be walking away rather than just asking if we had any questions prior to ordering i felt like i was annoying her she warmed up a little after and the food happened to be incredible the johnny bread was amazing and the white pizza  oh man i'd definitely go back,positive
My0ztUgvsTJhUhSBjI8F5g,we arrived around 630 on a friday evening  we weren't sure we would get seated without reservations  our timing couldn't be more perfect  15 minutes after we arrived the place was packedthe waitress was pleasant and very efficient  even though she was very busy she treated us like we were her only table   she gave us enough attention and allowed us the privacy and time to enjoy our meal in peacewe both felt our meal was well cooked and met our expectations  the menu selection was more than ample   i chose the lobster fra diablo and my wife chose the lobster and lobster ravioli  i would definitely return,positive
mLNSOU8Ki0Fm09xd6ZKkcA,i really enjoy timpanos the food is delicious and the live entertainment is great i prefer to go for brunchlunch as dinner can get quite pricey because it's mostly a la carte and i enjoy the bloody mary it mimosa bars before 2 on the weekends at night when there is music the restaurant can get very loud and make having conversations hard but that's my only complaintthey have a great raw bar as well we love to take part in many of the offerings the clams and mussels skillets are fantastic as well all in all great place and worth a try just go prepared to spend a little bit,positive
AU5C7IX0mogLK32u2EEOBQ,gia pronto has updated their university city location by moving down the block a couple storefronts into a larger location and they are better than ever they've improved upon the salad ordering area by having two salad makers work in parallel even with a large crowd of salad patrons this system seems to move incredibly quickly my new favorite salad starts with arugula then adds chickpeas grapes cucumbers beets and sprouts the workers here really listen when you ask them to go light on the dressing which i appreciate i absolutely love how they prepare the chickpeas and i doubt that they come from a can my salad totals up to around 9 and the quality of ingredients is outstanding the salad prices can get out of hand if you add too many toppings i also love the soups here i typically order the 10vegetable which is pretty filling and very tasty i do miss the soup sign from the former location which had information about whether soups were vegan and glutenfree,positive
9zmXopNy7R1tOyDOYueM5g,i've been to ami's once and it reminds me of tumo's restaurant  a small neighborhood casual italian eatery with good italian food that is a little on the heavy side  i had the lasagna  it was sweet and tangy and different than what i am used to but it was surprisingly yummy and the portion was large  the salad was good tooi didn't think it was any higher priced than comparable restaurants,positive
CTvHlHQ4jzRO8gkkl4O8zQ,my favorite pizza in st louis hands down i can tell that the owners are really eager to please and my servers have always been very attentive the pizza is yummy and the crust is flavorful the menu is small but i view it as the owners concentrating on making a few items really well instead of many items just ok cheesecake factory anyone  the restaurant itself is small as well but they do have a nice outdoor patio area i love coming here,positive
sTPueJEwcRDj7ZJmG7okYA,craving a jim's cheesesteak right now love this place for a great steak  have had it with just the whiz provolone and onions n peppers all delicious  i've had both pats and geno's and was disappointed  worth the wait  line always goes quickly and the staff is on point and enjoyable,positive

TE2IEDNV0RcI6s1wTOP4fg,simply the freshest corn tortillas around however they make large tortillas 45 which is the common size you'd find in a grocery market if ordering a large batch make sure to ask for pickup in the morning to get the tortillas fresh out the oven,positive
YuatbQ1sfTFnmfgjzVDv-g,45 we tried north italia today  the restaurant layout is really nice plenty of room and a nice size patio  as usually greenhills parking is tough but i won't count that against ni the service was prompt and unmatched you can tell they were learning as they have only been open for a few days and getting orders right we ordered 2 pizzas to start  one came out at about 1015mins after order and the second took about 30ish minutes they comped that  again proving why service is important although it was slow getting out  i'm never one to complain especially the level of service each member who stopped by to check on us whether it was drinks clearing dishes or just simply checking in both the mushroom and spicy pepperoni pizza were great i'd say one of the better selections in town as a regular in ny and having gourmet pizza there  it's not at that level  but for nashville it's perfect the meatballs  my damn were excellent the bolognese came with veggie noodles as i decided to carb up with 2 pizzas to start still tasted awesome  needless to say  thank you for coming to greenhills and adding a great dining choice i'm a bit bias as i could walk here the service is top notch  don't let that go away food is great with a variety of options i didn't give it a 5 as it wasn't the best pizza i've had but a good alternative to some of my favorite spots  looking forward to coming back soon if not regularly,positive

sTPueJEwcRDj7ZJmG7okYA,this south philly cheesesteak shop was a favorite of my south philly father in law so tradition guides me there when in town i will qualify that i have not been to genos etc as i have been informed they are not as good i have the feeling that this is a personal taste think but who knowsthis sandwich has a very large quantity of steak and it is not really greasy the whiz is in the bottom of sandwich and on top not mixed in the sandwich the onions and steak keep their separate identities as well onions perfectly caramelized the classic amoroso roll is entirely fresh service  don't bitch about the service in a south philly steak shop  there is a line if there was no line then that would be a indication  decor don't bitch about the decor in a south philly cheesesteak shop  it is not hipster,positive
mBgaPljP3OYkl_vGKTyFNw,mad props to the waitress who poured me a purple haze and poured it correctly with the bottle run i don't know much about beer but for some reason i knew that great attention to detailit was pretty crowded and loud and the food was a little pricey but i enjoyed this meal we got the duck salad and the pear pizza both of which were very tastybest part about this place was the diversity of the crowd thugs hipsters old families young families everyone,positive
8qhSEJ27l14Uv3Bger4eVQ,grille 54 is by far my favorite sit down restaurant  it is a couple of notches above carrabas outback and even bonefish grill  the quality of the food is outstanding and the service is excellent  last week i tried their new hummus appetizer with garlic tomato basil and artichoke flavors  awesome  they have valet parking and i'd suggest reservations on popular hours like weekends around 7 or 8  it gets packed,positive

ZQJGYnN9J-1JMLzeDFWocA,i have to say that i was extremely pleased with the food  there are people who are food snobs that would put their nose up at this type of place because it is a chain  but i got a coupon and happened to be at the apple store taking a workshop  the coupon was for the pork tenderloins  i think 1049 or 1099  i decided to stop  it was excellent  came with mashed potatoes made with garlic and a wonderful fresh very large portion caesars salad  excellent value  the trick is to just go for the special and you come out with a real deal,positive

IMCfwsS5hMrgSkyz_RlqLw,finally meeting my best friend in the whole wide world at joe boccardi'si didn't take any pictures cause i was to busy and focused on my visitbread and butter are always good when you are starving you can't go wrong with any of the salads  i opted to get a small nonna salad with the house dressing  i have to tell ya it was one of the best salads i have in awhile  cheese pepperoni  black olives onions yummymy friend had the baked mosccoli and i had the joe's special pizza deluxemy pizza was ok  i felt that the toppings weren't cooked  so i took the rest homeit's a good little place in columbia il  but it can get crowdedone note  we felt like the servers were hovering so it made it a little annoying and like we were being rushed,positive
lKU_kljhbEQKIPaM1Zbqiw,great ambience and even greater food  we went to little nonna's on a friday evening  our waitress was very friendly and charming  we were seated right away  the staff was attentive  we ordered kale and pear salad which was fantastic we both ordered spaghetti and meatballs and an order of garlic bread  the food was deliciousthe garlic bread was amazing  the bread came with toasted garlic gloves again delicious we would recommend this place to anyonekeep it up little nonna's,positive
gJctImPPLma_aRICoi8ZKQ,omg the lasagna here was amazing it was the best i've ever had highly recommend itthe service was also great dani was our server and was super attentive the experience was superb and we will be coming to dine here soon again prices are reasonable too,positive
i5C6RVgr03HSrgCl8oa1Fg,get the deep dish it's so good flavorful and just enough cheese and saucenot soggy order ahead and pick up girls have ready at the front for youreally good pizza,positive
Wy_7BrENm4clF9u_XRLPIQ,unbelievable sandwiches this place definitely gives amighetti's mom's deli and adrianna's a run for their money as top st louis sandwich place,positive
5qLhpWzinq5o00iZ3tQRrg,i first saw an ad for ziogio on facebook and wanted to try their pepper egg sandwich finally was able to come today with my baby i had the roast porkcheesesteak mix on an 11 inch roll it was so delicious with provolone and grilled onions had the fries with pulled pork and gravy which was so good the gravy was flavorful and had mushrooms i ordered the pepper egg sandwich to go so i could have it tomorrow friday for lent lol while we were trying to decide what to order the executive chef dave came over and talked to us about the menu and explained the cooking process of the meats and gravy he also walked us through the ordering process great job dave we will be back,positive
6r9FNW0-4aKqbPCX7UxTZg,me and my sweetie came for dinner on november 26th because i was given some certificates from maggiano's we were seated and our server explained everything to us that we needed to know the menu selections had some good choices too we had the salads mom's lasagna and fettuccine alfredo added chicken for dessert we had the tiramisu for two the certificate was actually for us to choose a dish to take home with us first of all let me just say that the food was good it really was we were impressed and we were very comfortable where we sat it was a booth which was really nice everything was nice and clean  the bread was warm and not hard the staff was very pleasant and yes i will go back again the only reason why i did not give five stars was because of two things 1 the staff came over and swept the floors while we were eating  and 2 the server was mia a lot during the time we were there   i understand why the place was so nice and clean and i also understand that management may want to keep it that way but not while the guests are eating do not sweep around the food and while your guest are eating wtf also although very nice we had to keep checking for our server she was not around when we needed her and we also had to wait for our check and almost asked someone else to get it for us we needed refills and even wanted coffee with our dessert but she was no were to be found when she did come by however she was able to get us what we wanted all in all we were pleased with everything i do recommend that if you are coming on a friday evening that you make reservations we tried to come a week prior but was unable to get in because it was so packed and had a 15 hr wait  so i do suggest making reservations,positive
gwfVq_Fmd3wGB31F_SX4Qw,so good everything seems homemade and freshmy only con is that i ordered shrimp and crab meat and there wasn't much shrimp or crab meat actually there was barely any crabmeat however the meal itself with the sauce was very goodwe ordered mild chicken wings and they were delicious i will return and give it another try,positive
pPZk4-MXRKoPM4muPuiLOw,i really enjoyed my dinner at this establishmentso typically whenever i get a craving for italian i get dragged to the olive garden which is loud cramped and has mediocre food last night i was able to convince my date that we should try somewhere new instead boy am i glad that we went to la cucinathe atmosphere was very romantic and intimate i was able to relax and not feel my ears bleeding within ten minutes of sitting down the staff was very prompt and polite and made me feel very welcomewe tried the spaghetti bolognese and the chicken parmesan both were excellent i especially liked the pasta that came with the chicken parmesan  it was lightly flavored with herbs that made it extremely delicious we finished our meal with a cannoli that i can't wait to try againso next time you're craving italian skip the garden and come here,positive
9mA9qYqiv4c0T9ASid3PIQ,attire  me and some of my friends got away with tshirts boots jeans so although it is dressy it doesn't have to beprice  it's expensive but normal for this type of steak place ie 40 bucks a cutnow let's get into it the food is really really good here  the steak i got the delmonico medium and it was really good  probably the second best steak i've ever had this one place in miami rondezvous on the beach so good and it was prepared very well  i recommend it highly i dislike the flavor of filets  i like a more meaty steak and this was plenty meatythe sides we got were mashed potatoes a 10 perfect blend of potato flavor and butter mac and cheese 85 a tad greasy but wonderful nonetheless and the truffled fries 7 a bit too much flavor  overall wonderful place i would like to go back more often just expensive,positive
DszOO6k_s2wuGhTw2AsUdA,this is best experience i have ever had here or maybe even at a restaurant it was my dads birthday and we really wanted to have a good time the wait was about 15 minutes which was faster than we were told we were sat right in the back which was great since we had a small child we already knew what we want so we ordered our food and drinks at the same time salad came with plenty of breadsticks our waitress melissa was amazing she is the real reason that i will keep coming back again and again she knew the food and what was suppose to be on the plates my moms order was missing something they remade it in a full order since she got the northern taste of italy boyfriend's food was misplaced they gave it to us for free we didn't expect this or even ask for the deduction the manager was amazing we had a very great time i will tell many people about our experience we said it was my dads birthday they didn't sing which was fine wasn't expecting a great desert on the house either they were donut like and came with plenty of chocolate and raspberry sauces i would get it again we tipped melissa great and i will be coming back and asking for her her humor and sweetness was a great quality  i didn't get the managers name but he was petite and quiet he knows his is great manager and if he doesn't then i hope he reads this again we had amazing time,positive
v2Z_d9d2GWCVUTtPg5ucRw,even if you're not in fine dining i'm sure that you've probably heard about this establishment if you live around the st louis areathis is by far the fanciest restaurant in st louis  jacket is required and the ambience is really highclass  the service is toptier and so are the customers eating here  the food wasn't the best i've ever had but good enough  this is a place to go in st louis if you're more about dressing up for a special occasion rather than enjoying the taste of the food,positive
4QMIJJWQOh7zpEwOXhFJqw,lusciousloved it at roo's our meal was delicious a designer pizza along with a starter of caprese ingredients were so fresh and delivered so beautifully made so much better by our server madeline and then we met renee who we instantly felt like we've known for yearsa joy to dine here wish we lived in tucson we would be back to renee's organic oven time and time again oh and thank you for the tip renee on the music you had playing we are listening to pandora's pink martini station as i write this terrific background to your dining experience and now we get to enjoy it homecheers to you all the best hope to see you again sometime soondon't miss out on roo's everyone really special place,positive

seouwqRlM9YNNAkZS09FuQ,i recently heard about jet's through a friend  i always get their coupons in the mail but i never gave them much thought  i just figured they were another run of the mill average pizza joint    i ordered the pan pizza because i heard it was very good  we had the meat variety version and a chicken version   both pizzas were very good  they were a bit pricey but most of the better pizza places  are  i would order from them again,positive
erz6oUEJdx787WyOlxMARw,these are the experiences that make me wish i was born an antonio and my ma called me tony what an amazing dose of old school italianthere were only two of us here's what we got a waiter i would die for fried calamari eggplant rollantini baked lasagna like no other gnocchi romano bolognese and a la carte meatballs and italian sweet sausage for dessert portions are sizable and the red sauce will not disappoint if you have a friend in town take them here this place makes the philly food scene truly special,positive
GJnYFvk9kbM182bKMFSAvg,great spot for lunch and a cute little patio to sit on if it's nice out both the italian and arugula salads were delicious and pretty large portions for entrees we both had pasta i did the full size cannelloni and had one noodle leftover which i brought home and my hubby had the pappardelle half portion which was huge the only negative and it wasn't that big of a deal they only had one server working so service was a little slow and it was tough to get refills of iced tea but i would definitely come back,positive
j0ib7Ketxwsz_9F__DYWFQ,pizza is great i got the meatball parmigiana pizza and it was amazing however i made a special order for to add moz sticks to as a topping and the owner called me that i would have to pay in cash the extra 4 i said i only had 10s and if the driver would have change he rudely laughed and said my drivers have change for a 100 well the driver did not have change for a 10 and i have to overpay them ontop of the tip i already provided on my cc in hind sight i should have used the tip the payment,positive
DHzvDHtS0nmvJCt5qpag2g,this is the 2nd time i ordered the seafood florentine soup  the 2nd time it came with barely any seafood   the rigatoni  crabmeat had frozen crabmeat  dirty flowers in dirty water is a pet peeve of mine  stick  wthe pizza,negative
4PgNs7K7gGfGqXNHwAgyzQ,ugh not worth the hour and a half wait for delivery there are way too many pizza places around to wait for this place again the food is decent  but when we called after an hour they clearly had not started our order and that is just poor customer service period i don't care if it's a friday will not be ordering again,negative
avB60OOVc_YOyfbz2AqL_g,no air condition when we went for party of 10 for birthday told the manaager on 7312017 guess the don't want our business because he did nothing to rectify this won't be back for future parties ever,negative
-o6bah2j6_IH9pkwANXcLA,pizza is amazing service is beyond terrible was told my pizza would be done in 20 min sat there for 40 before the bartender realized my order had been done said bartender was too busy drinking beer and eating pizza with all the other waitresses,negative
rugDoz-A6vL-FG-8PbvOag,wife and i went to brio for dinner last night this is our second time there in about a year the first time was excellent this time not so much we arrived and were pleasantly greeted at the front door and reception area we got our pager and were told it was about a 45 minute wait instead of waiting we decided to walk through the mall we returned about 40 minutes later and they thought we stole their pager apparently the wait was only 20 minutes they did their best and found us a table in less than 5 minutes which they didn't have to do since it was our fault for not being there we sat and our waiter greeted us wife ordered wine and i a soda when the drinks arrived her wine tasted like it was watered down i'm not a wine drinker but i'll sneak a sip here and there if it tasted water down to me it was i ordered wedding soup and the wife mozzarella and tomatoes my soup was all broth and one meatball with a couple of pasta if i really dug to the bottom took 5 minutes to get ahold of the waiter to send it back when he returned i had about 8 meatballs but about one good spoon full of veggies and pasta bead came same time as the soup and i think that it should have come with the drinks wife loved her's everything was fresh for the meal wife had mahi mahi and i had a pasta which was supposed to have pancetta in it it was good but i couldn't find or taste the crispy pancetta wife said her fish was good but the bed of faro was dry and inedible desert which was an oversized shot glass took 10 minutes to arrive milk chocolate carmel cake i think but it was good we had 6110 left on a gift card and the meal was 6154 i'm glad i didn't pay for the meal our server was pleasant but wasn't johnny on the spot to please the soup incident left a bad taste in my mouth as did the wine i don't think we'll be back,negative
jt1TfLJQN20aoVskD_8DuQ,let me start by saying i have been going to this restaurant since 2005 in the past year the issues that we have experienced are making me truly consider never giving them my business again and that is heartbreaking because i would consider myself a regular i actually loved this place butthe new wait staff is rude and inexperienced the owner continually acts like he is annoyed that people come there to order food take a trip over to lazo's and chat with the owner there  that is a prime example of how customers should be treated if you show up when the food isnt ready even when you are on time they act annoyedthey now charge you for even using a credit or debit card this is disgraceful you should be prepared to pay those fees from the credit card companies not charge your loyal customers extra on every tabeating there on a regular basis we started to notice that the food was hit or miss some nights which is disappointing because some nights it is so goodi really hope they start to get back to there old selves  angelinos right now is not worth my money,negative
bjqW95lP4MAMOgFn5EyGDA,this was a scandalous meal because it took 1 hour for the food to come and my vermicelli were not only cold but they were swimming in this milk like sauce that had no flavor my mother's veal scallopini were covered in breading and there was hardly any veal inside the salad was the cheapest caesar salad known to mankind the cheap dressing also tasted more like ranch dressing then caesar dressing a meal for two people cost 50 bucks what a rip off be warned don't go,negative
wlfpN7V_f4HW5yKHTAJm5g,i clearly ordered a half cheese half pepperoni pizza i got a sausage and pepperoni pizza completely different from what i ordered completely ruined my appetite i guess you don't have to be literate or have common sense to work at hungry howie's it was also my first and last time ordering from this location,negative
EB69_8Q9xlG3RdzQWOKAjA,the only reason this place has business is because of their location across from the convention center the convention center food is awful and there are no other restaurants close enough for lunch i had a chicken sandwich that was fine and filling service was friendly but the owner is incredibly rude he screams at you and refuses to seat you if you don't reply to him in the right way it's awful but given your choices it's the best you might be able to do,negative
t5Xc0u9yvOH0-DgmrCS60Q,pizza cold after 10 min drive no salad dressing was provided as requested the counter lady was very professional and pleasant would have preferred a different type of cheese on pizza pizza crust was excellent,negative
d73Cf2TYRPsweXCxeK7WQw,very rude waitressowner doesn't care if their employees close up early and turn away business will never go back and they are over priced  stay away from this place can't post zero stars it won't let you so 1 star to post,negative
a3hMPdQ2sBIyX32JH20uEQ,raw chicken parmesan sandwichim taking back by this mgr jason wanted to make me a new sandwich are you kidding me  what about me getting sicknever will i order from there again and might be a long time before i go back to carrabba's or outback  dont deserve any stars,negative
thaxF2Bnvu29xdXCf57ULw,saturday 71313 i drove to exton pa to see my fiancee since i don't know the area well she suggested we eat at the restaurant where she has dined before what a catastrophe  some background info on myself my late wife was italian we were married 25 years i've been a widower 15 years i frequently eat out in little italy in manhattan and the bronx i know italian food and proper restaurant service   it must have been our server's first day that has to be the reason for the calamity she took our order i asked for canneloni and she chicken parm with no cheese  your basic milanese and an appetizer of spaghetti a glass of house chianti and a peroni and while we watched other tables that came in after us receive their bread beverages appetizers and hot food we wondered what happen to our order when the order did arrive it was all at once the food was below 140' f that's a health violation back in new york incorrect and they ran out of peroni the server took it back and another server came back almost immeadiately with another meal we wondered how that is possible did we get someone else's food the only thing that arrived in a timely manner was the check  needless to say my fiancee was disappointed she tried to make us happy the server didn't  ps pasta is supposed to be drained with a little sauce and al dente and chicken parmesan is not a thick piece of chicken deep fat fried the chianti tasted watered down  i don't think that was your usual night but it did put a damper on ours sincerely bob soneira,negative
01Yl8rIjOsaLrwre78jugg,so disappointed we were really excited to try this place as it was new to the neighborhood  we sat ourselves and waited and waited i guess this is a order and pay up front selfserve restaurant where they bring you the food nobody told us this when my salad arrived it tasted like it had been premade the day before with processed meat  my son ordered pizza  thin crust and the top under the cheese was not cooked and doughy really thincrust pizza undercooked  when we sent it back the manager told us that they prebake all their pizza crusts before service due to their large menu same with their salads premade due to menu size  i had higher expectations and could have made it better myself never going back would you want to spend money on a place that premade all their menu items costco food court does it better and charges way less,negative
QDzxlMlwKWdrFlvZdJErSg,it has taken us 15 years to return to deanna's based on a past mediocre experience  we won't be going again  the restaurant was under staffed  we were ignored when we entered  we waited over an hour for our food  the fried cheese was the texture of leather and drowning in a balsamic reduction except for the capers the clam sauce was unseasoned and tasteless i make better in my kitchen my husband ordered the puttinesca which was underwhelming  he has had much better  we won't be bothering to return to deanna's,negative
3DCbl5GrBX0CH71jbSC74Q,i am writing this review because my dad has been a long time customer at angela's and takes the drive to get a traditional stromboli not a pizatta which is a personal one the same woman has been working the counter as far back as my dad knows and even said to me when i picked my dads food up one time i know your dad he's always in here getting his stromboli well when he went the other day not only did this lady argue with him about his ordershe also told him never to come back againwhen my dad said you know me i always get the traditional stromboli even has the price down to the cents she then replied i don't know you i don't know what you're talking about my dad just brushed it off and took his food and left she then called my fathers cellphone 2 minutes later to tell him she gave him the wrong order and to come back and hand the box to the customers that are waiting for their two slices of pizza which she messed up she didn't even make the guys new slices just waited for my dad to come back and hand them their box ew anyway the point of my review is that woman should be fired she has poor customer service skills clearly doesn't know how to take or give out an order and told a long time customer to never come back again when she was in the wrong  unbelievable,negative
JFShrvfR86GnWUaITaGRkA,horrible wait time for bigger parties then 4  made us wait an hour to let us know that will be another 2040 min  very unprofessional and was dissatisfied  with the communication ended up leaving and went to el sur an amazing place to eat,negative
MZRvuUt9WUDI2hHFHyQi8w,like many reviews on here i too was staying at the drury and looking for food nearby prices were not cheap and food certainly did not live up to the price had the raviolis which were very bland girlfriend had the pepper loin plate which was a well overpriced shaved steak sub minus the sub roll can say we had ron as our waiter and he was fantastic the entire timeoverall prices were quite high especially for this area and the food was bland would not go back,negative
n9FawYfi8T0Rou6mVuaigQ,first time in been looking forward to trying this place i love italian food so let me break it down the waiter was good nice kid  pretty attentive ordered a glass of wine for 750 and wouldn't do that again tiny glass and not worth it i'd get a beer next time ordered bruschetta they laced theirs with way too many onions couldn't believe how overrun with onions it was when we picked out the excess onions it was pretty good but wow won't order that againfor entrees we gto chicken piccata it was pretty good and i mean that unfortunatley  i ordered a pasta bowl ziti with pesto and chicken it wasn't good didn't even finish half the pesto was way too light and tasteless and you really had to search for the chicken i mean it was almost nonexistent and the ziti wasn't ziti it was like an elbow pasta so sorry gina's you get a 2 star rating i will go back and try the pizza it appears it's really just a pizza place bummer i had hoped for better,negative
OHplb2m_dKPXY46mS0CqJQ,i just returned from a shockingly horrific experience thanks to the chef who seems quite unbalanced  our party waited over an hour for several appetizers which only arrived because we inquired as to the problem  then we waited another 45 minutes for most of the entrees to appear the final entree appeared 10 mins later  when we asked to see the chef to discuss the problems he told us that it was our fault as part of our party was 10 mins late and that apparently we had never been to a restaurant with made to order food  he screamed at us and told us to get out and never return  we've been to restaurants all over the world andhave never experienced anything quite like thissort of similar to the soup nazi in seinfeld  the food when it finally arrived was tasty but destroyed by the experience overall  the rolls were hard as rocks and the caesar salad brown and soggy but fish dishes and pasta were good  we had to uncork all of our wine and water glasses were never refilled  overall abominable service the likes of which we never experienced in 30 years of living in manhattan  i would never in a million years recommend this restaurant  go to paris a few blocks down for polite service,negative
vxLV9tci88Hsr1G01uleag,the owner has decided to change their design no more individual slices except for the daily special no more table service no more delivery and no more bbq shrimp my favorite was the pga and since the changes the quality of it has suffered  i guess this is an effort to improve business but i don't think we'll be coming back,negative
hB3-7Yg-x_eXMypf5VxKuw,meh not really great  had the salad with prosciutto except it wasn't prosciutto they used just plain old sliced ham  that was pretty disappointing  the pizza was just ok and as others reviewed it is really small  we also got a tiramisu but we got it to go and haven't tried it yet so no comment there  even with a 25 restaurantcom coupon we paid almost 30 including tip always tip on the amount before the coupon is applied  overall the place has unrealized potential,negative
ez1xAIwSguvgj3F8B7uJsA,i really wanted to like this place given the good reviews but unfortunately i was left disappointed the outdoor seating area was nice but the inside looked just like a corner bar and not an italian restaurant they had a lot of italian dishes on the menu but the interior aesthetics didn't fit the menu options bar food options would've been more appropriatei ordered the gnocchi and white pizza the pizza was something you'd order from a fast food joint the gnocchi was terrible and it was the first time i couldn't eat a dish i ended up getting a second dinner at another restaurant afterwards because i was unsatisfied i thought it was funny that the drink menu tells you to drink responsibly but they spelled responsibly wrong on a positive note the sauvignon blanc was really goodthe only reason pepperoncini gets two stars instead of one is because the service was fantastic service was fast and the waitress was friendly and inviting,negative
YNgX5_SYHCXSoL9IMdVboA,we used to love getting our pizza here especially since i was able to get a good gluten free pizza here within the last year we stopped going because the pizza sauce had changed and was really salty not wanting to cook tonight pizza sounded good so we decided to give them a go again my gf pizza crust was dark and really tough on the edges i ordered it with black olives mushrooms and bell peppersthe pizza had no flavor my husband wanted a personal pizza which they used to have and had to get a 12 works the pizza was still doughy and also had no flavor to it baffling the pizzas turned out so bad since there was no one in the place and three people working maybe it was an off night but our order was definitely not worth the price that we paid we'll be sticking with our homemade pizzas for sure they are far better all the way around and a whole lot cheaper too,negative
s2eyoTuJrcP7I_XyjdhUHQ,there was a time when i ordered from bros 23x's a week but that all stopped when i continously received my orders wrong the final straw came when i ordered a sandwich and received one missing the meats that made it an italian sub i finally had enough called fredcomplained and was basically ignored he apologized but didn't even attempt to address the ongoing problems decided i'm done with them until today six months or more later so today at 1130am i  ordered shrimp scampi for coworker and a chicken cesar salad for myself   was told by fred it would be 45 minutes to an hour ok at 1230 calledoh he's in his way out the door now it's a five minute drive he finally arrived at 1250 i could live with that except my salad was so soggy and wilted it didn't even look fit to eat i salvaged what little still had a crunch the ribs of the romaineand the chicken threw the rest away  my coworker said her scampi was awful and never to order for her from there again i  would complain to fred again but it would pointless too badthey had such promise i won't be ordering from them again,negative
MGXIPVN409ilHG-UMPtc8g,macaroni grill has always been a favorite of my husband and iso we decided to try the newly rebuilt opry mills location  what a mistake  the tables were so close together that our waiter had to squeeze between chairs and hop over  my fav of all time mushroom ravioli was awful 4 ravioli with a thin sauce and chopped up button mushrooms  his penne rustica was ok but different  no larger glass with ice and water was offered when ordered with my meal  only the cool water they leave at the table we were afraid to order dessert so went somewhere else  i feel like they have cut back on so many things to pay for the new building  our bill was 3900 with 1 beverage and water will we go back  no,negative
-sSGKR1V1oBm7BJicIXozg,i'm a big fan of dave magrogan's restaurants and i was excited to try this place despite all of the negative reviews i've read on here and heard via word of mouth  sadly i was very disappointed we arrived a little before 6pm on a friday night and i wasn't sure if the place was open there weren't many cars in the parking lot i expected to at least see a crowd for happy hour the place wasn't busy at all the service was very good everyone was super nice i have no complaints at all about the service the food was nothing special for an appetizer my boyfriend and i shared the braised meatballs veal and we both agreed that they were very good i had the pear salad and i thought it was just ok my boyfriend had the eggplant parm which he enjoyed i tried a bite of his pasta just to sample the sauce it wasn't bad i had the penne pinoli and couldn't eat more than a few bites the ingredients in both my salad and entree seemed of poor quality if we didn't have a balance remaining on a gift card i wouldn't be quick to return however i hope my next experience is much better if so i will post a followup review,negative
3GfRnrzvwac11XozXE9mzg,1695 for a cheese pizza that at any other place would be considered a small or personal sizelike other reviews pizza was around 11 inches with a large crust blue cheese was put on a pizza that was requested to not have itonline ordering is complex and not straight forward lead to another pizza being screwed up2 out of 3 pizzas being wrong only one correct was just cheese56 for 3 small pizzas that didn't feed a family of 4won't be going back,negative

hWtwQeecwoFiUgNNDaf8Ig,we had heard so may good things about ita101 that we were truly looking forward to a great meal my wife made early reservations for my birthday dinner and we arrived with a party of six we ordered and things were going well then the food arrived since the menu was heavy on pasta dishes that's what everyone ordered that's when things went south every pasta dish was dry and over salted to the point that almost everyone took home most of their meal my wife and i took ours home and tossed them out the next day when we attempted to see if we had missed something maybe we hit the chef on a bad day but for us ita101 was a one and done,negative
0E4Qo6Glr2pWkF6L9MJqbA,i'm giving two stars because we have eaten here before and the food is pretty good tonight though we were seated and were ignored by multiple servers walking by our table the servers we saw were more interested in socializing among themselves rather than waiting on our table after an appropriate amount of time lapsed without anyone asking if we would like a drink we got up and left i have no tolerance for poor service,negative
1PGF-zUnu2uxHqRWo06k7Q,i just picked up take out from this place they give me my bill with the veal at 44 but online it's 34  when i bring it up to them they tell me the prices online are 3 years old but do not take the extra money off my bill that i was not anticipating on spending i suppose the tourists will get them through it because this local is done update your website and stop being lazy when called out on it poor business food is decent but not worth the false marketing,negative
NtglwXi9aLXenlprL49MjQ,waited an hour and a half for cold pizza and the delivery driver made me go out to her carhad to call 4 times before i could ask where my food was twice i only got the hold ads and once they just sat the phone down on the counter,negative
5aylC28sgOxLa1OLF0BIRg,great environment but food quality and serving size little to desired spaghetti with sauce wasn't really that tasty had lots better there was water pooled in bottom of plate wife had veal with mushrooms serving size was that of a child's plate she was happy but she never complains the food wasn't plated as it should be at a so called classic italian restaurant  i should probably  try them again but wont waist my money i would drive to mario's or lanzas in kings beach,negative
shbDs7N86yTsfZLh4Nie_A,not a single employee was wearing a mask correctly no one was enforcing that customers wear a mask or social distance i felt incredibly unsafe being in the restaurant just waiting to pick up my pizza the service was slow  i ordered aheadprepaid and i still had to wait 20 minutes past my scheduled pick up time please avoid this place at all costs,negative
QDzxlMlwKWdrFlvZdJErSg,despite deanna's having a large neon bar sign out front this is not the place to go to enjoy a few drinks even if you are eating dinner the meals i've had here were fine but i was cut off after 2 mixed drinks because of the count not my behavior a third drink in the course of an evening dining out does not seem excessive i know others who have had the same experiencei can understand and respect that they prefer to be a restaurant not a watering hole but their policy has us dining elsewhere,negative
YHvJyyklyzsQhCnbJu7pFA,nasty overpriced pizza nearly 5 for a slice of pizza sauce was very sweet and watery don't be fooled by the cars in the parking lot they belong to employees no one needs or should want this tear it down and put a gas station or something ppl will use waste of time and money yuck you should be ashamed of what you sell,negative
lPUuhmHAuAJLrzdBD8Bkyg,horrible customer service and just bad business the receptionist was absolutely no help after messing up our order mixing up as well as forgetting food when i called to fix the problem they not only didn't offer to send back out the food they forgot but charged us for the food they had mixed up the only decent thing is there delivery is quick but fast food comes with a catch,negative
Hu5fC_pfgZ6O1LTPwLQQ9w,looks like a cool and hip place to eat in wayne but we were not impressed  after we were seated i noticed a pretty girl in the back by the kitchen who wiped her nose with her hand several times and then  was constantly running her fingers through her hair and flipping her hair around no hat or pony tail right by the food  it was all i could do to not walk out then  she worked there but i have no idea what she was doing i had the tagliatelle with shrimp and zucchini  it was barely warm and the pasta was stuck together  not much in the way of shrimp for a dish costing 25  the other two diners got pizza both were decent but again quite pricey  one was 20 for the pizza of the day with arugula and prosciutto  this is the second time we have been here and don't feel the need to return,negative
ntsN09UfQSlRWO37guMKMw,i wish i could leave negative stars this place sucks for what they charge for their food 60 for a 20 meal i will never order from these thieves again i feel just like i got robbed i'm far from cheap i just know the difference between a 60 meal and a 20 meal not a place for locals,negative
PP3BBaVxZLcJU54uP_wL6Q,okay for a late night grab after drinking all night but you can find a lot better sandwiches in the city if you want to experince flavor and tender meat,negative
BtesR_IjhMMkrVhwdg5APA,salvo's was special but not anymoresalvo's had the best sicilian pizza i've ever had  but not anymoreapparently they changed the ingredients especially their meats there was not enough cheese on the pizza to be able to taste it to see if that was changed alsosalvo's sicilian pizza was almost addicting i could hardly wait to go back and buy some more but over the last year or so their pizza has morphed into a typical no tasteflavor pizza typical in this areai did not mind paying 25 for a large sicilian pizza it was worth every penny but now 25 buys a pizza that to be quite honest is not any better than a frozen pizzai have come back over and over again the past year or so thinking maybe they would change back to their old recipeingredients if it ain't broke don't fix it i am done with the new salvo'si was going to give salvo's a 3 star rating as now they are just average but 25 for an average pizza i had to reduce it to a 2 star rating,negative
-sSGKR1V1oBm7BJicIXozg,im updating my review the first time i came here everything was excellent from food to service each time i've come since the food has declined to the point that this last visit will be my last food has no flavor and neither does the pizza service was fine but food is just not good,negative
g4KzJc8y7BhW66ieNIwJEA,i made reservations for 25 people for my daughter's birthday 2 weeks before the date i called the day of to let them know we were coming and they said they had no reservations on the books they literally took down my full name phone number and number of people coming when i made the reservation the manager did not try to accommodate us at all he said i don't have the reservation you made and it's a busy night you can come in but you'll probably have a long wait never again stepping foot in here no apology or attempt to correct the mistake we went to demos' steakhouse and they accommodated us immediately,negative
ArNDRug3p5zngNHiLivnFA,the worst of all breakfast airport joints i've been to  i ordered at the kiosk instead of having a waitress  my flight was at 645 am and i was in the airport by 5 am so it was convenient that this place is open that early unlike a lot of others around it because i ordered at the kiosk i wasn't allowed to sit at the bar and wait or eat there  it was bizarre considering the restaurant was empty and i bought food from them  also bizarre because it wasn't a quick wait took probably 20 mins for my food but i get it it was early and i was one of the first customers i got a breakfast sandwich and potatoes with a latte  came out to 25  talk about overpriced under quality airport food  the potatoes were okay but the breakfast sandwich was so bland  i think i needed to get the bagel toasted or something because it was super stale and drythis place did what it had to do which was fill up my hungry belly  definitely won't be back if all other options are closed like when i was there maybe try a premade option and definitely toast the bagel,negative
Sh1jcQBOyBnJde_bI4icGw,we've been here twice because we really wanted to like it but both times it was disappointing with last evening being awful the appetizers were fine the burata a combination of soft fresh mozzarella covered with solid mozzarella was tasty enough although the bruschetta served with it were burned and not enough came with the dish to have with all the cheese the hunter's egg white beans and a thick tomato sauce with pancetta over polenta was good and certainly a large enough to be an entree in itself for my entree i had the grandma's eggplant that was almost inedible because the bottom of the casserole was so burned and the charred flavor permeated the rest of the dish my husband and one of our dining companions had the red snapper and neither could finish it because it had such a potent unpleasant fishy flavor and odor the menu does not state such but it is bonein our other dining companion had the grilled pizzaiola sirloin steak with tomato sauce which was also overcooked based on the food alone this would rate a onestar but the service was excellent our server was attentive but not overly so responsive thoroughly knew the wine list and could describe the menufor as pricey as this place is we certainly won't be back for a third try,negative
fFB6Pe2dNUdPr3EhBtPxsA,the positive is that the guy working in there was super nicegreat dude  almost makes me feel bad to say thisjust moving to conshy from manayunk we thought this was the same kind of lenny's that is on ridge ave in manayunkthe awesome one with a menu board the size of a house wall and incredible unique sandwichsubs on great bread with excellent meats cheeses and toppingssauces  anyone who has been to lenny's in manayunk understands thisi thought this was the same thing and sadly it wasn't  go to the grocery store and get italian meatcan make your sub just the same at home as lenny's does  will never go backbut anyone who compares this to the real lenny's in manayunk would never step foot in here  but the guy working was really nice,negative

RZtGWDLCAtuipwaZ-UfjmQ,chef was rude and management worthless when we simply wanted to substitute pasta for a vegetable not only did they not accommodate me and charge me for the veggie the chef visited our table not to appease me but to question why i felt that vegetables were healthier altnernative to pasta  seriously the food is mediocre at best so no love loss here old city is full of wonderful and better priced restaurants won't be visiting nor recommending this place ever again,negative
csfMjRRfr-sku6L6bhEf_A,let's start by saying i enjoy conversation and human interactionthat's why if there's an alternative to this type of facility i will gladly choose it the food and drink like most airport restaurants was overpriced and it just ok but what really has me unhappy about this facility is the fact that you don't talk to personi think the entire wait staff and manager said seven words to me the entire time i was there for two hoursyou order your meal and beverages from an ipad they bring it to you slap it in front of you turn around and walk awaydon't misunderstand i get it i'm a technically savvy olde dude i also am a business owner so i understand with an automated order system you don't need as many people taking orders and delivering food if all they have to do is deliver food then you can work with fewer employeesbut as i said i enjoy interaction with another human being maybe that's old fashioned if that's the case i will be oldfashioned i will also look for an alternative to this type of facility every single time,negative
7nLhB3qajGwq4HvOCsGT5A,not impressed whatsover bad service over priced small portions food is ehh would not go back not to mention a sub par atmosphere very disappointed if you ask for you pasta to be cooked al dente and you are toldthe pasta has already been made red flag,negative
WLrFLRE9uvqj9ahrEjevYw,it had been a few years since we went to barone's maybe it was a bad night on the positive the outdoor dining space is nice and spread out and quiet our server was nicesaid they were short staffedwhich was odd bc it was the weekend indoor dining opened to 25 so would have thought there was better staffing we sat at 615 our order wasn't taken til 650 at 730ish the server came and apologized saying they were backed up there were a few indoor diners and about 60 full outdoorswhich dwindled as we sat there food came about 745so almost an hour since time of order my husband got lasagnasaid it was fairsalty i ordered chicken and asked for double veggies instead of potatoesit came out with potatoes so i asked server to bring veggies not a big dealhe was going to pick up the plate to take back when i asked him to leave it bc now it was 1 12 hours since we sat down i tasted the foodtasted like saltgreen beens completely ruined with salt the chicken salt and the potatoes that i didnt want were actually cold i went in and asked him to not bring more as the food was terrible and to take off the bill i did acknowledge it wasn't his fault  but it was just too terrible to eat and i tend to salt my food a decent amount really disappointed as it was a beautiful night outside and i ended up stopping at rita's water ice for dinner defnitely won't be returning,negative
sSzoKdBQlU2DvNurOHxCFQ,food was inedible way too salty  we took one bite of each dishes which were tortellini cheese in bolognese and meatball and fettuccine in vodka and alaskan crab then threw the rest awaythe owner and management of this restaurant rather took words from the chef than the customer when it comes to food quality  hope their chef will be ordering food from them everyday then,negative
KgDBWabaF6J7R6TH0l4I5Q,ordered delivery last week specifically the night of 111620 one cheese thin crust pizza via postmates  it was inedible burnt cardboard like crust burnt cheese no visible sauce my kids wouldn't eat it  my dogs wouldn't eat it i tried it and literally spit the food out  literally the worst pizza i have ever tried we love pizza and i trying to be understanding but this was completely unacceptable tried to work this out through postmates with absolutely no resolution i hope this isn't the norm,negative
F00qGEKYhqD43At669lcjw,eh it was ok i was  kind of dissappointed actually we've been eating here since it was on tv and everything has been delicious however we picked up food over the weekend and it was dissappointed we were given maybe a handful of fried calamari if that ceasar salads were tasty but again so small and there were maybe 3 croutons seriously definitely not good portions for what we paid tasty but small you'll need to eat again after you eat it's a shame because there is no consistency with the place which is why i think it seems to fall each time it has picked up over the years a friend went to the show rat pack on 1110 and she said the show was great but the food was terrible on the buffet they couldnt even get a drink except for a glass of complimentary wine because they forgot to renew their liquor license how do you forget to renew your license not sure what is going on here but this has all definitely changed my mind from having my sons graduation party here  so all qand all food was good but child size portions if that,negative

ZHMwj4mU6oE-o6WK4leiSQ,ordered for pick up at 415 on christmas eve got food at 830 pm  there was a disaster with the online orders  i still do not have an answer for what happened but there were at least 30 orders that were delayed hours i totally get that things go wrong but we were constantly told it's coming up  i waited in a lobby crammed full of people during the highest corona numbers for 4 hours  it was impossible to get a refund because the staff was in full chaos mode  there was no management  leadership or organization just chaos  and they still told people as they were coming in that they were behind and it may take an hour even with a lobby full of people who had been waiting at least 2 hours after 3 hours  i attempted to get a refund but was told they couldn't issue the refund to my card there or give documentation showing my cancelled order but should see it hit my bank in 23 days  i couldn't take the chance of not getting 200 refunded so i was held hostage for my food  after finally getting my food home the food was so terrible we threw it away and had to eat a frozen pizza  several people said there is always a delay with their online orders but never this bad just want to warn people of what they can expect,negative
fItfK47cKnpb07DfpQmx-A,ugh well this is a local's favorite from day's of yorethe interior is dim worn and did i mention dimlooking at the people there you note that many people are greeting each other and saying hello like they have coming there so long that they don't care what the food tastes like any morethe food is average at best the interior is dim and uninvitingtldr dim grungy interior and passable food do not make a special trip  you can do better if you take a date here for the first time it would be your last  hides from all the locals,negative
GN9P7lMDZMy8hHEYJdX-7A,food good employee suck i just wanted eat in a decent environment  and all i listened to was imos employees complain about other imos employees the woman complaining and gossiping i think was the manager i'll go back but not eat in unless you like negative people bitchingps most of the employees look dirty and unkept i guess what to expect at a pizza place,negative

TzO_cLqL_qu7ZASRVz0_MQ,this place has the absolute worse customer service over the phone i was rushed through my order never told the total amount or the delivery fee that i owed and i was never told how long it would take for them to deliver my food they didn't even bother announcing the name of the business when i called i had to ask if they were milano's a flyer for this business was placed under my door at the holiday inn express at 920 broadway in nashville tn i'm not sure if they had the hotels permission to deliver these flyers to the rooms it took 45 minutes for me to get a small stromboli wings and fries my food was lukewarm and this small amount of food cost me 2480 the wings were small and did not look appealing at all the stromboli was okay but barely warm this place is only 2 miles from my hotel i'm very disappointed with the service and the presentation of the food don't waste your time or money,negative
GrsFMEYd3d0UWYo7WpxTPw,don't waste your time trying this location second time in a month it was closed at lunch time  1200 noon and someone is in the store but it is locked and they aren't serving pizza does anyone with little caesars corporate read these reviews  looks like this is a very common problem at this location,negative
01Yl8rIjOsaLrwre78jugg,the food is alright but every time i go the service is trash i've waited at least 15 minutes to get a drink every time the table next to us also waited a decent time for a drink and we were pretty much the only people in there it also took an hour and a half for a calzone,negative
zD96G9ETAAQwLJnLqtCnyQ,famous pizza worst pizza i have ever had in my life and what makes it worst is i was craving pizza all day and decided to give this place a try since a friend of mine recommended me this place  first the dough was too thick and soggy as hell the sauce had no flavor the cheese was moshy like chewing bubble gum  who ever thinks this pizza is good need slap up side the head with that pizza i'm from ny and this is an insult to pizza  save your money folks,negative

KDzLMPTTLihnpcctZLmg0g,came by for dinner yesterday for my mom's birthday and for something with this price point sitting in sun dial i expected much more i read reviews before i came so i can't say i was surprised we had a party of 7 3 under 12 and a 545 reservation as soon as we walked in the hosts greeted us kindly and we saw the rest of our party so we joined them quickly before happy hour ended our server put in a few of the hh item foods for our table shortly after she came back to take the orders of the kids at the table there's not much i can say about our server other than she was nice friendly and knowledgable when she was actually at the table i'm not sure how many other tables she had but for a monday at the beginning of dinner service while it was storming out it didn't seem very busy the hh items we ordered came out in a timely manner as well as the kid's food tar tar calamari and truffle fries were good but nothing spectacular the tar tar was my favorite thing we had all evening the kids all enjoyed their choices as well started our meal with the burrata and tomato salad which was good however over salted i suppose the whole sea salt gimmick was cute however our server told us we'd get bread and olive oil in which we put the salt in so we could decide which salt would pair best for our entrees our appetizers came before bread service which isn't a huge deal but we had to ask for bread service while waiting for our entrees long after finishing our apps the bread was cold and nothing impressive you can get better bread from carabba's we ordered a half dozen oysters for the table and after waiting an hour and a half asked the server if they were on the way the kitchen lost the ticket or the server forgot to send them back but the raw oysters didn't make it to the table until the entrees were being presented to the table we were presented with a dozen oysters we were only charged for the half dozen we ordered i don't think we should have been charged at all and the presentation was neat and well labeled by the time our food finally came out many of us had lost our appetite my mother ordered a cut of steak which was cooked properly but dry two at our table ordered hogfish i ordered the salmon and my partner ordered the chicken it's a good thing they give you salt to season your dish because all of the fish we ordered was bland and under seasoned my risotto was mushy salmon had no flavor but the baby carrots i ordered added a great flavor to my dish and i loved the color variety i tried the creamy polenta that came with everyone elses meal which was not seasoned either i boxed up my food and figured i'd take it home and add something to make it taste a little better overall based on this experience i don't think i'd come back any time soon and i certainly wouldn't recommend anyone with little patience dine here we had good company and ordered a tempranillo from their vast wine selection so we didn't feel the minutes pass by but by the time it was 830 my mom just wanted to leave so we asked for the check which was around 550 and i left our server a generous 120 tip out of personal guilt knowing the server wasn't at fault for the amount of time it took our food to come out nor the way it tasted i wish a manager would have at least come to the table to apologize for having to wait an hour and a half for a raw item to arrive at the table for a reservation celebrating a birthday and spending nearly 3 hours in the restaurant i don't think what we spent was worth the experience we had if you're dying to try it go to the bar and just order from the happy hour,negative
Q22UzlwqkRkISP7LG4WXzA,was at the river rd location with my kids for a quick dinner  have been going to this restaurant at both locations for years  usually get a salad with grilled chicken as i did tonight  the chicken was grilled and smelled so bad that try as i might i couldn't eat even the salad  my 10 year old daughter kept asking what smells so bad  i asked the waiter to take the whole thing away  a guy then came to the table didn't introduce himself or tell me who he was but assured me the chicken was fine and there was nothing wrong with it   um except that it smelled like feces  honestly i have been to this restaurant at tanque verde many times  is it good customer service to tell the customer something is absolutely fine when they complained and didn't eat it  they actually took it off the check which surprised me but i don't think i will be going back,negative
-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w,the server was very short with us for showing up near close and the hot coco was more like a soup of a melted hershey bar neither a beverage nor delicious i also had to put alot of sugar in my coffee to make it bearable not the evening european cafe vibe i was hoping for,negative
zlNtAPz4GvSUiljQ-D3cvQ,this is some pretty low shelf pizza trying to figure out if they are a front for something because they can't be making money on the food seriously  ingredients seem low quality first time i went pizza was served overdone just not a good experience looks like it might be a fun place to hang out and drink,negative
a52ldK1JA8qtZOm17PVNMQ,these wings looked like cadaver meat with no sauce very dry i felt like i was surviving an episode of the hunger games the antipasto salad was average but back to the wings after i ate some i just realized and thought to myself no no i will not endure this feast of low quality chicken wing meat overcooked under flavored if i was lost in the desert and i had a choice of water or these wings i would say give me the water why because i already have the desert and dryness upon me take pride in your food sir deliver something great not something that is subpar for prisoners,negative
6_37iH47aHnMODiXVl-gUg,worst calzone we ever had it was under cooked in the center and the bottom was not edible it was burnt i don't see how little italy let this one get by their pizza and food is always good this happened to us twice in a row thought the first time was a mistake but not so we have been eating here since they opened  that's a long time sorry but i had to share this maybe it will be corrected,negative
AaVhP2MWhU5ID63UpigYeg,this is the worstwe went to the buffet on tuesday evening and when we walked in there was two pizzas on the buffet that they combined and looked as though it had been there for a while  we were seated and asked if we wanted the buffet and she said she would be back for our drinks  she came back after we called her over for our drinks she took our order and never came back  at this time it had been 20 minutes  she then comes back and hands us our bill still no drinks  i asked if they were bring out any pizza this after i had been up there 3 times to check  same pizza was still there when we walked in  the waitress said we forgot about the buffet  other customers were also getting upset  we left and will never go back  as a side note the place was dirty and they had about 7 people just standing around behind the counter,negative
YK-pF0TjZBu9q6esscCvrw,apparently they were relocating to east nashville because they were too busy at the nolensville rd location and needed more room i have yet to see an east nashville location open and their website has been canceled it was a great little place such a shame it closed,negative
zlfydjffYAIEj6vsh8tVvQ,last time we experienced friendly workers  it's not easy to locate pizza outside my kitchen that offers eggplant as a topping  lots of toppings to choose from if you like your pizza extra crisp they're willing to cook 'er to a crisp,negative
SzV7Gwiql507h6d0BgT_7g,i'm sad to say that i will never be eating at gino's again me and my family eat there all the time and we really enjoy the food unforunately i called tonight for delievery and my street is one block out of there delivery zone i asked if they could make an exception since it's literally one block and since me and my family spend a good deal of money there the girl told me the owner wouldn't send the driver because of the neighbor changing not really sure what that even means one block away is safe but apparently my block is not very disappointed,negative

hUl_zNzmwMd8TD8pPL81pg,we knew to expect the deep dish pizza to take awhile but we ordered the small 7 and it took over an hour to make it out to our table and we were expecting it to be piping hot since it took so long to cook but no it was colder than room temperature not sure how that happened i don't think i would have even enjoyed it if it were hot it just reminded me of eating cold lasagna the crust was doughy and chewy and the pizza sauce reminded me more of pasta sauce i had high expectations based on the reviews but we just did not have a good experience,negative
e7lDxjbPfLfsxIDoJczccg,the only reason this place got a second star is because my dinner shrimp and crab pasta was really good and the guy who brought our dinner to us was really nice our actual waitress was not impressive at all the only thing that we got quickly was the bill it took an hour and 10 min to get our dinner,negative
HrnSaz2f1WUEoAQQ6iD6gw,booked a room here during busy time of ucsb moving in it was very expensive but that is not the problem on the website they show very nice pictures of the rooms and facilitywhen we got there  we were extremely disappointed  our room was a dump starting from the second we got into the room  we had a bad odor it smelled like a dirty dish rag right away we opened the door to the balcony to get fresh air in on the balcony we found rat poop on the chairs and floor so knowing there are rats running around we couldn't leave the  door open for the night to have fresh air in the stinky room  our bathroom was filthy one of the 2 hand towels had what i am assuming a wine stain on it the carpet was so dirty which i think the reason for the smell in the room we couldn't take our shoes  off we were exhausted and went to bed just to be awaken at 300am by a very loud noise sounding like a car alarmannoying whistle  very very loud i got up to check on the noise thinking it's coming from the parking in front of the front door  it was our toilet that was making the noise i messed with it and after i flushed it the noise stopped  went back to bed got awaken again by the alarm at  700am that we did not set up this was a very unpleasant stay and we never thought we would end up in this situation for such an upscale price in such an upscale area,negative
yEa_sWqLpmB5NbXyAz_g_A,this place is terrible don't ever go there just kidding it's amazing it's just a little small and i'm always afraid there won't be room for me some of the best italian in south philly and a truely authentic neighborhood gem,negative

9n-1LQLX3ntBfBtMwgSpig,for fast food pizza which is what this is the food was not badcertainly not a pizza to go out of your way forbut the service is terriblewe were seated by the general manager who pretty much just pointed to a seat  no menus no drink orders no real greetingfive minutes later a teenage kid who had been standing the whole time by the counter talking to friends decided to come over and ask what we wanted  he seemed confused when we asked for menusthe pizza came out and three of the six slices were warm and three coldnot that cold pizza isn't goodbut nobody came back to ask how they were  but hey they have free refillsyou just have to go inside and get them yourself,negative
sTPueJEwcRDj7ZJmG7okYA,underwhelmed  whenever we go to philly to visit my hubby's family i insist the first stop from the airport be for a philly cheesesteak  for the past few trips he took me to the place his brother used to take him on penn's campus abners which to me just seemed like a mediocre college drunk food place  on our recent trip to philly i insisted we go to a famous place  being the foodobsessed person i am i read articles polled people who went to school near philly and jim's seemed like it was going to be a real winner  between the hype and the hour long line in the cold i might add by the time i bit into that sandwich i was very underwhelmed  it was pretty bland and standard  i guess this is one of the places you go for the experience but i left cold smelling like meat and disappointed  i'd rather go back to abner'sas a side note we did give the cheesesteak a second chance at some pub across from our gate at the airport on the way out of town and it was delish so next time i'll skip the drive and hour long line and just grab one at a less hypedup place,negative
koDNU-pfvo87HJAkMF7R3g,i've given this place too many chances being the only pizza place on grubhub in the area i naturally go back to it out of convenience the last time i ordered i tried to play it safe by only getting appetizers the chicken fingers were completely over cooked and the marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks was gross  they can't even do simple appetizers i'm done,negative
rGOJdLRl1KwCz_9hxeDR4A,i really hate to update with anything negative in today's atmosphere but bad is bad and it doesn't deserve a pass  we ordered a pizza and some mozzarella sticks from mama's for pick up last week  i was just that desperate for pizza and wanting to support the closest local restaurant to us  we got there about five minutes before they said it was ready  it was done promptly in their quoted timewe live a mere five minutes away and i was starving so i dug right in  butwait  the cheese was all congealed and had a dull luster look to it  why  because it was ice cold  they gave us a pizza they cooked probably many hours earlier and just had sitting around  what a disgrace to serve to your community at times like these  we had to put it back in the oven to resurrect it and it was just as flavorless as i remembered mama's being  the mozzarella sticks were hot at least  not the side sauce thoughi will give them credit for being able to put the food into my car for a contactless pick up which is why i generously gave them 2 stars vs 1 star  but they wouldn't take payment over the phone so you're stuck using eatstreet who charges fees if you want to go 100 contactless  sillyi'm never giving mama's my money again  ice cold pizza  why even quote me a time  tell me you have a stale one all ready for pick up asap  i'll sooner go to mcdonald's,negative
VC7VTddnZmY6RQoLQd_49A,good food terrible service with limited staff very hot in the restaurant they wanted us to move tables once we were seated for half an hour  waiter came to our table limited times overall poor experience and never coming back,negative
jr1PQwG2r6je2WcdDJ9rNA,let me start off by saying i love pizza and it is very hard for me to not love pizza but let me tell you i do not love this pizza by far the worst pizza experience i have ever had my stuff crust pizza which costed 17 was actually see through no lie i held it up to the light and it was see through it was also under cooked the cheese in the crust was solid but that's not all i ordered garlic bread knots as well and there was literally i can not make this up no seasoning or taste to it the cheese on the inside was as you would expect solid just when you think it can't get any worse i take a bite of my cinnamon bread sticks thinking how how in the world can they mess up cinnamon sticks but surprise these microwaved solider than the cheese sticks of cinnamon booty left such a bad taste in my mouth i thought there is nothing left to do besides write a bad review on yelp and pray it stops just one person from ordering from this actually unbelievably bad pizza shop,negative
lPUuhmHAuAJLrzdBD8Bkyg,i hate to trash a local business but i have had several issues with this pizza parlor in the past riverview bad then pulled it because they help our community i heard that they switched over to a new owner so i tried them again pizza is what it is but the sides were disgusting greasy and burnt yeah they still put it in a container and sold it to me at full price,negative
k0ujvMXwrxv_BWEiXJ2ywA,my first time here place is just disgusting microwaved pastas  everything on my table was dirty and sticky including the table if you don't believe me just open the pepper and parm cheese shakers  pizza was ok but for your own safe eat it  home,negative
qeGoudzR2NO9KtLdmSHtpQ,i will never order from this place again placed an order 820 pm and received a confirmation around 10 i still haven't received my food so i call the woman who answers asks me for my address and she then states your food will arrive shortly the driver left awhile ago 45 minutes later i call since my food still hasn't arrived and get no answer or any food so the moral of the story is don't order food from this place if you want to eat 4202016,negative
0LuNIBiqt24Tv49aWc8AFA,do not stop for the togo hard shell crabs my husband and i did yesterday and dumped 2400 of crabs in the garbage when we tasted them  when we ordered the waitress asked if we wanted them to finish cooking them or if we wanted to take them home and cook them she explained that they were partially cooked to keep them from getting mushy i have been cooking crabs for 30 years and never heard of this practice but then i don't own a restaurant mushy was an understatement the meat was like paste and we promptly threw them away thinking an emergency room visit might be in our future if we continued while we were waiting for the order we noticed how dirty the place was in the areas that you could seewe wondered what the condition of the kitchen was like since they obviously are not concerned with cleanliness in the dining area  angry that we wasted 2400 and then i had to cook dinner anyway i would have given them no stars but that is not an option,negative
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,not my favorite due to the copious amounts of grease there are many better places to get pizza in goleta gina's woodstock's and pizza my heart to name a few pizza is pizza though so 2 stars,negative

RTJiMomkeeDi5LZn0GhxQA,too bad we were not able to enjoy our drinks or meal here it seamed like a nice menu they are new in town and need to train their staff much better after ordering our drinks we were informed we could not drink or eat at the establishment without our passports yes passports we just had normal id so unfortunately we had to leave the restaurant very ignorant staff manager too bad but we found the kingfish which was not a disappointment thank you curio,negative
JO76ifyAiBiRPNx_3S0jNQ,good stuff mexican style tacos with a good selection of meats so corn tortillas with al pastor lengua etc served with simple onions and cilantro  one of the few places in orleans parish that does this also tried the torta which was very good a surprising hit was the free sample of the their bean soup at the beginning of the meal  excellent good selection of cheap mexican beer  they do a large 30oz size for 7 which seems like a good deal to me overall i liked it and will return  particularly for their specials nights  tuesday is 1 tacos and wednesday gets you half price pitchers of beer 7,positive

H_QJ-uXvcniXgUBB_0euCw,so good fresh seafood really friendly and helpful staff we were served a generous and very delicious ceviche in lieu of chips and salsa  it was complex with flavors that unfolded with each bite and served with a zesty salsa verde we asked for guacamole even though we didn't see it on the menu that was delicious too my lunch partner thought it was a little heavy on the onion but i liked it i love onioni had the caldo de 7 mares and it was just perfect richly flavored broth loads of seafood and delicious garlic bread for dipping my lunchmate ordered the red snapper on the waiter's recommendation and it was delicious but a little tricky to eat she did say she wished it was served with more rice instead of the french fries but she enjoyed it very much we both had more than enough food and went home with boxeswe definitely plan to come back to try the stuffed pineapple andor stuffed coconut love this concept it's very unique in stl the seafood is so fresh the flavors are excellent and the service super friendly this place would get an easy 5 stars if it had a liquor license and if the decor was a little more comfortable but even without that i will be back,positive

ErcLBEFjqr4nGbF4ozrvgg,let me first say how happy i am that don barriga came to west philly it's been a long wait for a good genuine mexican restaurant to come here i seriously hope this place lasts a very long time here when don barriga had their grand opening on june 16th we went there to order some pick up order as the photo shows there was a constant line as many reviewers have written i don't think the restaurant expected this huge turn out it took them about 112 for our order to be ready i actually was not upset because i saw how swamped they were and the wait staffs were actually very professional and in good spirits despite how busy they were i was very impressed i wanted to keep the order simple so i ordered different types of tacos tacos were very good i waited to go back and this time i went with some friends for brunch we ordered various breakfast entrees and i have to say we all enjoyed the food restaurant opens at 10am and we were there at 10 we were the only customers until around 11am the service was friendly and the food came out pretty fast i wanted to try their tamales but they did not have them that early i guess i will have to go towards later lunch or dinner for them the prices are very decent and really happy i don't have to go to south philly for good mexican food when i get the craving,positive

L8ny0WbdhoZSCicHh_fBCA,this location is right by my work and i'm kinda well known now there due to my frequent visits most of the long term employees know just how to make my order if they don't have what i want they go out of their way to make it for me even near closing time i'm very addicted to the chips and guacamole some days the chips are a bit off if they used too much lime but most of the time they are perfect,positive

mFd-j_KM90IOamGmoN5AQA,45 stars dinner here was pretty great it has a nice open ambiance the service is super friendly and attentive and pretty much everything we ate was tasty the only slightly disappointing item was the guac  which of course is a big deal it was a little lackluster and paled in comparison really to the three salsas in particular the light brown one all of the tacos i had were superb and were filled to the brim basically with meat they also didn't crumble midbite which is always a worry with tacos the carne asada and baja fish were my two favorites but honestly you probably can't go wrong with whatever you choose just make sure to diversify and try a bunchthe sides are a definite must especially when sharing the sweetchili glazed potatoes are basically drugs you will not be able to resist them once they're on the table the black beans are very solid too the corn was probably my least favorite of the three  served more towards lukewarm than hot  but still quite enjoyable,positive
HiGSwE3dV_u5OnLok3jfKw,first timer here ordered some food to go and was very pleased chicken tacos campechano taco al pastor burrito and chicken enchiladas in green sauce  least favorite the burrito  the al pastor was a bit too sweet too much pineapple flavor for me but the campechano taco was quite delicious as were the enchiladas the chicken tacos were a hit as well watch out for the green and red sauces they give you to accompany the tacos a little dribble goes a long way the food was ready and hot when we got there to pick up and we will certainly be going back to try some more of their dishes i'd like to try the chips and salsa but we are more likely to take the food to go maybe next time we'll go in and wait for the order and see if they offer us a snack while we are waiting,positive
z1sipz951JQRL-1-aJfCmw,amazingly fresh ingredients the salsa bar with fresh jalapeños and cilantro was a nice treat to add to my fish tacos the staff  atmosphere was friendly bright and cheery will definitely be back soon the food here is like a party in my mouth,positive

XSuO2E30ArnrjH9jquaK5Q,i've been to this place twice before for dinner and yesterday i went for brunch i find the food to be pretty good here i usually order either a rice bowl for dinner or an egg bowl for brunch you stick with that you will be fine the servers are usually very friendly  also prices are very reasonable and it is never a long wait to be seated even during brunch which is usually crazy at most places i would recommend this place to others,positive
XMGNjPd2qo6Lo1mXW8OlGA,my wife and i ordered from this location today we used door dash to have it delivered to our house when we received our order it was like i was at the restaurant both our orders were fresh i had the steak nachos and my wife had the three cheese queso with ground beef and beans i just love all nacho chips they give you well twenty minutes later after we were stacked and stuffed full of nachos i decided to write this review go here people but wear your stretchy pants because you are going to need them ps the queso is a tad spicy and now the tums,positive
D_yOtY3N32iXf9RqelHVlw,this place is a great 'neutral' place smack in the middle of the grove that has an interesting food menu  the food is decent and they have a crazy drinkshot menu that can be fun  they expanded their patio which is now incredibly huge  they also host special events such as burlesque and live musical acts  definitely worth checking out,positive
fJ6AA9S7SEq3sim_3Sim3g,i went with two friends and we enjoyed everything we ate the lamb corndogs were a little lacking in flavor but that was ok i would recommend the yucca fries and the beef short rib biscuit both were really tasty we had a very friendly and efficient server the prices are average with a cocktail we spent 3500 apiece   the only reason i didn't give this a five star  rating is the shoefly pie if you are going to call your place shoefly you better have a great shoefly pie my family is from quakertown pennsylvania and my fathers family is pennsylvania dutch i have eaten shoefly pie hundreds of times in my lifetime and have never seen or tasted anything like what they are serving it was a crust less dark brown blob that had a sharp ginger bread flavor i'm sure there are some people who have tried this must like it or they wouldn't have it on the menu but for me it was such a disappointment   i will happily go back and would recommend you go especially if you are a vegetarian or have one in your party that you are dinning with i just would not recommend this uber strange version of shoefly pie try the toffee crunch cake one of my dining companions order it and with one bit i was full with regret for not ordering it   by the way if you think i'm obsessed with the pie there is a reason you should go to pennsylvania and try a piece i would recommend landis market wet bottom shoefly pie you can order on line you will understand after one bite,positive

H26zRyQkXXYzUZUOtppFcA,how have i not reviewed the green lemon i have been here countless times maybe i was unconsciously hoping other people wouldn't catch on although my conscious self would never think that the green lemon already has a lot of love here on yelp and rightfully soi really enjoy this locally owned and operated trendy texmex restaurant the decor is colorful and modern and the place is an eatery but also boasts a clublike atmosphere on taco tuesdays and i believe on the weekend night with an addition of a dj don't quote me on the weekend entertainment but i would call to check i've visited here countless times and every time has been enjoyable i really adore that they have happy hour until 7pm each day which includes some food specials including a trio or tacos like margaritas this place makes some of the best you want to try this frozen margaritai have been told by a staff member that the frozen margaritas are legit if you're not a huge fan of the traditional like you can get it with a fruit swirlstrawberry raspberry or mango i am a straight up margarita drinker and i even like indulging with a frozen one want a 60oz margarita for your birthday or to share no problem have at it the tacos are street style and ohsoflavorful i enjoy the taco ingredient combinations they use i adore the ahi tuna tacos and that i can get them on bibb lettuce any of the tacos is customizableyes i'm that annoying customer i ask like the grilled mahi taco as well i get those pretty much every time i have also been to the green lemon on saturday morning and they put out a great and flavorful brunch menu it's a nice alternative to waiting for a table at their wildly popular for brunch sister restaurant daily eats  while i'm at it i'll also let you in on a little secret that ciccio'swater also has a bomb brunch and it's not as crowded as de check it out if you're a first time customer don't forget to mention for a basket of complimentary churros on the house service has always been stellar and the staff really does a great job at being efficient if you're going to try to hit gl during high frequency times you should anticipate a wait update green lemon no longer offers text ahead waitlist option someone in your party must be there to get on their waitlist the restaurant hostess will input your phone number and name and the system will text you with updates on your table you can also see where your reservation is in the waitlist portal online this will give you a realistic perspective on how long the wait is and when you can expect to be seated,positive

DOoJrrsqGzZN2FqzvllKnQ,the food is soooo good here  the red salsa and mexican corn are amazing  however i am not sure why they are charging 5 for valet most places in nashville do not even charge  we would normally give a valet a 5 tip but here you would have to hand over 10 to accomplish that i think it would be so much more beneficial to the attendants if the fee wasn't charged,positive

Zl6sqGgp3X4HAdr9t5BE8g,we went to pick up tacos for breakfast and were not disappointed i got the 4 and 5 the 4 is a very cheesygreasy chorizo mix and is pretty good the 5 is even better avocado eggs black beans and some hashbrowns also add an interesting bit of crunch to the taco they might give you three salsas a yellowish one a red one and a green one and say they're mild medium and hot salsa contrary to looks the yellowish one is the hot salsa i think the red one is medium and the green is mild but they just have different tastes this was a great meal we got to pick it up about ten minutes after we ordered and i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes breakfast tacos in any way,positive
FaDboHLpVcN01oL8EYTX2w,came here for lunch twice pretty solid food and very nice staff i tried a bunch of tacos and the asada al pastor and carnitas were all pretty good i also love their rice i have a thing for spanishmexican rice did i mention that their complimentary chips and salsa is pretty amazing my friend only comes here for their tripas tacos which he swears by and my sister tried the lenguas tacos and she loved it awesome place for a quick lunch you can't beat those prices and plenty of street parking nearby,positive
xSn2d1RTvK7e4KM0bI2NLg,this place is great  drive thru margaritas who cares what you look like mentality and a good food fast style  the girls that i go with are such regulars that they started stocking corona light because the girls have asked for it from time to time  don't like standard salsa  that's fine  they have a build your own salsa station  the chips are served in clay pots  love the simplicity of this place  definitely go for the fajitas  only drawback of the place is smaller and seating can be tight when they are busy,positive
rSLmA5fQcgfj4kCgZez3pg,absolutely delicious steak quesadilla and a good cause a little bit pricey but still worth it,positive

mCRa6o1eEVQr1bqV4Wy6KQ,25 cent oysters for happy hour um cannot be beatin nyc there are 1 oysters a plenty for happy hour so since the gulf spill the lack of oyster happy hour options in nola is super frustrating yea you can find them for 1 but you can do that in manhattan too  while i usually stick to the quarter we drove by this place and my boyfriend spotted the 25 cent oyster sign  so naturally we headed back uptown the very next day to down 2 dozen oysterswhile i'm not a huge fan of the general ambiances of most nola places the 25 cent oysters ensure i'll be back during my next visit  also my boyfriends drink was literally too strong to drink a plus in my book  and only 5 each along with the crazy cheap oyster deal i just wish this place had existed and the specials when i was in law school living a couple doors down,positive

41oaEXXCeIPXPj-oM-TIJg,service was quick and friendly no cars in the drive thru ordered mexican pizza combo tacos were soggy and pizza was good this place has been a nice addition to the community cause there are not a lot of fast food in this area however this visit around i believe i have encounter some food poisoning my stomach started cramping in the middle of the night then followed by nausea this was about 4 in the morning when all this occur after about 30 mins of cramps i was on the throne all day nonstop with some vomiting as well not sure what went wrong but will not be returning i'm still hurting,negative
yS0TsUzKBQlHQCZZeBrxww,i don't know what all the hype was about but these tacos was not good first of all they were very dry we read all the reviews and were so hype to get these tacos on cinco de mayo and when i tell you 1 bite to 1 gallon of water to be able to swallow these tacos i'm not exaggerating i literally could not swallow 2 stars cause it did smell good,negative

wU0pnVCtf23mxXjPzhCacA,i wanted to like flaco's since they're connected to the excellent momo's however our entire meal was subpar was start to finishchips thick and greasysalsa seemed like canned tomatoes with no spicesguacamole large veggie chucks but blah favordrinks weak and below averageentrees we were both underwhelmed my wife's was meal was way overcookedthe service was good but that was about the only positive,negative
xfoQquijuSs6SdI76DpFfQ,publico has a great atmosphere inside and has a very knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff also the food was pretty good unfortunately i wouldn't return to this restaurant again and here is whythe prices are dramatically overpriced when i looked at the menu before coming i assumed that you could get a sufficient meal for about 20 per person however after the waitress explained the menu i realized this would be impossible the 11 price tag on most of the taco dishes only get you two small tacos that quite honestly don't outperform a couple of the other local taco joints in st louis mission taco at all the side that we paired with our entrees was a disappointment as well we got the arepas and these were also a disappointment while very good they were very small and didn't match up with the 14 price tag i ended up paying 25 for my meal no drink and then i proceeded to drive home and eat another meal i understood what this restaurant was trying to achieve and if prices are absolutely irrelevant to you then sure try this place out but to most average consumers i think that you will leave this restaurant feeling hungry with empty pockets,negative
J1O6PznPMZaQi_qp0o-D-g,we ate here on a sunday night  the food was as ok  the only problem was it took over 1 hr to get our food  when we checked in with the person at the counter she said their cook had called in and they had no one to cook  this ruined our night very unprofessional,negative
a2AeLWy4Fi7XOOyOY7PLig,it was fast friendly and clean over priced and pretty bland had the chicken maybe the sauces are what's special about this place i didn't try them the nacho round chips looked like they could have been kroger brand i was out in the area but wouldn't make a stop again,negative
6gCQvovXf3wmrfwuTyeLlQ,i was excited to visit the bus after viewing it many times on food network  i can say the proteins we had were tasty carne asada carnitas don't bother with the rice or beans  it seems as if place is run by teenagers with no adults in charge while one of the servers was serving food some guys jumped out of a car and jumped him  they proceeded to beat him up right where we were eating not good for business since it appears no one is in charge there were no apologies no cops called  no one offering the table a comp dinner where the fight took place after the fight most of the staff disappearedok food  nothing to write home about we ate quickly  left  very upsetting evening,negative
UBIG1I0th2sSLekfXo-7jA,nope nope nope if you desire to order food with a side of hair be sure to think twice as the manager may come out and blame you i paid full price for my food left a small tip foolishly but i don't like to make a scene i just wanted to get the heck out of there i'm so glad my effort to get a babysitter for the evening landed me in an almost argument with a restaurant manager mexican restaurantsnext,negative
KmZuIc9o_PL2BW8j_7gy7w,i went to reforma monday 615 and our waitress brought us waters while she was very friendly both glasses were disgusting and looked as though they were not washed there was food stuck to the side and floating in both glasses now normally i would just ask for new glasses however due to covid19 this is unacceptable i understand the dishwasher may not get every glass sparkling but if cups aren't getting clean who knows if the silverware is servers should be taking every extra step to ensure the safety of their customers picture does not do it justice,negative
_O4ODcdwtL_XH_eVOUf7hA,i love taco bell and you can't beat it for the price but every single time you go to this location either the drive thru is extremely slow or they screw up your order if you don't check your bag chances are they left something out i can't comprehend why this is such a huge issue with all taco bell's especially this one it has got to the point where when they successfully get everything right i am blown away,negative

uqsJ4HJWaPuQMc55ahwiDA,paloma always struck me as a cool place to eat the restaurant is dim and ornate with a patio and tin starshaped lanterns on the ceiling i had two crunchy tacos a shredded chicken and shredded beef for taco tuesday at 2 each a two taco combo with rice and beans is 15 my first impression was their huge size they were stuffed and not lacking in meat shredded lettuce or cheese they were rather greasy though one of my bites from the beef taco was mostly fat i was full after eating the one taco and could not finish the second the three complimentary salsas were better than a lot of other salsas in town the red one was on the generic tomato sauce taste end of the spectrum but not bad what was excellent was the waiter he came around a few times and felt like a genuinely friendly person all the staff was above averagei probably wouldn't come back unless i was craving tacos on a tuesday night but then again goleta does have taco bell and los agaves,negative
zBfYuwdybeMHfLuUbO1Ung,i came here with a group of girlfriends for a work dinner  we were there during happy hour which is always a good thing for me  however this is not going to be added to my list of favorite happy hours  i ordered a 99 cent margarita and a chorizo bean dip and tried some of the other items that my friends orderedfirst the margarita  i'm sorry i know it's only 99 cents but it wasn't even worth that  i could barely finish mine  it was sweet and weak  i didn't even taste a hint of tequila in it  the chorizo bean dip was all beans and no chorizo  the guacamole and salsa nothing special and someone told me they used to serve a variety of salsas  one friend ordered the allyoucaneat tacos and another ordered chicken fajitas  they both seemed to enjoy them but no one was jumping up and down  service was friendly but not very attentive  my friend asked for green salsa several times before it arrived  checks are paid at a desk on the way out meaning that rather than paying at the table you have to wait in line for the one checkout attendantfinally it's in a casino so parking is not convenient and you have to secondhand smoke a pack of cigarettes on your way intoo bad i had heard great things about this place  i would give them another try for dinner as they seem to have decent reviews however i will not return for happy hour,negative
uSIGgRScZmpWlEcHtoaWlA,we took two guests to blanco last evening we ordered drinks and appetizers and told the server what were our main course choices the drinks arrived followed immediately with all of our food brought at the same time needless to say having all of the food served at once put a damper on the meal oh and the food was very very ordinary we will stay away,negative

4D19uG4enigRAsvTVmn61g,awful experience went in there for a torta asada got there at 1118am ordered by 1119am i waited for 20 mins for mind you a 5 min sandwich  i'm not the kind of person that goes around complaining but this was crazy i know they forgot about my food cause when i hit it it was cold the meat tasted old yes it was to go no limes and 2 napkins with 1 tiny container of red sauce which was pretty good so if you're gonna go to this place better call it in at least 1hr before and it wasn't like they were packed they had maybe 6 tables full out of 12 i understand mistakes happen but not even that it was ridiculous maybe they'll improve on this after this review or maybe they'll stay the same regardless i don't think i'll be going back,negative
6LsQkSM9l5vtcOcolS1YeA,this place sold groupons and now refused to honor them i know this has to be illegal the goupons sold for 11 for 20 in food i followed all of the terms but they put a notice on the tables that they will not honor them unless their new conditions are met stay away,negative

ctOOp80WBFPj3wPZyFw1tw,visited this taco bell many time and would generally rate it about 3 stars tonight if i could give 0 stars i would i pulled into the drive through line at about  10 pm on a saturday night waited in a stand still line for about 10 minutes before giving my order when i arriived to the window i was given the wrong drink i nicely told the employee it wasn't what i ordered i could tell just by looking at it she then gave me the wrong drink again and i told her what i ordered she slammed the window  and her and another employee rudely pointed and laughed at me i didn't know poor customer service  and being rude was funny but to each their own when i got home in addition my food order was wrong one star,negative
a8CrdVtlfa3JDoC_ADW8dA,main complaint is that their rice tastes horrible  it does not taste the way mexican rice should they use lima beans peas and carrots but its some type of spice or chile or maybe they soak it in tequila not sure but it makes it taste gross chicken tacos and enchiladas are good  so are the refried beanstheir service is ok  silverware not very clean and their prices are higher than comparable restaurants in the area,negative

DEmAmcR4xNilT5WY5ImEFA,the food is average we got the loaded nachos and tacos not fans of the fake meat so we just subbed it with carbs the spicy sauces are really spicy so beware,negative
BYPpaYGiBr1dGlF1pOH9-Q,well after spending 18 minutes in the drivethrough line and there was four cars ahead of me i get my small fries and it looks like they are halfway gone and what was there was not fresh or hot  there was none in the bottom of the bag either so they did not fall out since i was on a lunch break i could not go back or anything so i had to eat very fast and get back to work the sign in the window says 15 an hour maybe they should rethink that with the slow service and poor quality food,negative
NbC8iSIU7gqTTCJ8i5VbPw,is this really supposed to be a mexican restaurant i walked in not even during karaoke time and someone was drunk singing billy jean by michael jackson i ordered a regular margarita and it tasted like half water my friend ordered a mango margarita and could barely drink it because it was so sour the salsa tastes like tomato sauce purée and the rice is greeninteresting,negative
93P7EZuTWD-eRmjUthhHpA,staff is unfriendly and unwelcoming every time you ask a question it seems like they are very bothered one server in particular drinks a corona at the bar while on the clock this is a very unprofessional place the food is okay but i would not recommend coming to vallartas brandon the new tampa and wesley chapel locations are excellent,negative
YV32ObbYe10BXeIydrnuOQ,canyon café is bar none my favorite restauranti dine here regularly i can't say enough great things about their fajitas and limit 2 margaritas they also have a wonderful blackened tilapia  crawfish that my friend orders unfortunately this time around the tilapia was not up to its normal standards it was thin and wasn't as tasty maybe we should have complained to our waiter but we aren't the type and we weren't looking for a refund  instead i mentioned it to the manager after we paid the bill his response i haven't had any other complaints about it tonight wow what a terrible answer maybe nobody else is familiar with how great it normally is we would have felt a lot better if he acknowledged that we were concerned on their behalf and were trying to help them continue to be our favorite restaurant  sadly i'm not sure my friend is going to be so enthusiastic about visiting canyon café with me anymore,negative
V2uSS4OumRDvuVM_2ZSc1Q,we went on a saturday night due to the good reviews and the fact that the place was considerably busy my bf got the rib eye entree and a he was not impressed and b frequented the bathroom a lot in the 3 days after he had this meal we didn't have any other meals out of the ordinary that day so it's safe to say the questionable meal was the dinner we had here my meal shrimp tacos was average and came out cold the decor and the waitress was nice and service was smooth otherwise we did not have dessert,negative
rU139D5Zl5928RYoXYSURA,have been going to carmelita's since the 90's but no more i have mostly had to get to go orders since being recently home bound one thing that irritates me is you don't get complimentry chips and salsa on take out even though price is the same as dine in my last visit to park street they pored sour cream sauce all over theenchiladas when told not to and it was not the first time when i called the manager to complain she wanted to argue with megoing to try the mexican place on johns pass next time sorry carmelita'sps we will miss carol the waitress,negative
6UzLtXTdLJKNHmn70J29Ig,i deleted my very mean spirited review of this place instead i'll just say don't go here service was awful food much smaller portions than expected not worth it,negative
E3QSrua1cXWaurPitBhKGQ,great food  but the svc is left to be said  the reason i say this is because i'm a regular there i eat there at least twice a week i was sitting there last night i need 32 retired have breeze was staring at me i made a comment to them not to stare at me anymore and i was asked to leave so do me a favor you people that own this restaurant trust me the gentleman that works the name is jose he ever put his hands on me again i will have him arrested i will see you guys for whatever i can because i was in danger it all right i had three men staring at me for whatever reason that i ask him to stop it and i was told to leave so that tells you something about service and good customer client services there is in this place has the a pitta me of a fucking shit hole and i mean shit hole,negative
vQTFffd8OFO8PN94NkQXKw,the service was awful i respect small businesses but the restaurant is understaffed to a degree where it took us 15 minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant another 20 minutes to get our drinks and about an hour to receive our food the food was decent and was reasonably priced i'll probably never eat here again,negative
1oJ_UcVoTHSAYgu53YiJQA,don't bother coming here xolo is completely unexceptional in every way we like mexican food so we were curious to try xolo since it took over the space where fuji mountain used to be and we shouldn't have bothered i ordered a steak fajita that had absolutely no seasoning or flavor it was overladen with peppers and the corn tortillas that came with it looked and tasted like the storebought ones i buy at acme i make a better fajita at homethe guacamole at 950 is overpriced you get about a large ice cream scoop's size and they don't prepare it tableside and it isn't any better than other guacamoles out there i'd say it's worth about 5 7 at most and that's being generousour waiter was not very good and bordering unctuous now i understand why besito in ardmore is always booked xolo is fastfood mexican dressed up as fine dining whereas besito is actually creative original and delicious,negative
zTIOa5RufkL3NNKXwrBKLQ,the worst dinning experience we ever had hair in my food burger was rare when it was supposed to be well done took it back came back rare again i wouldn't even recommended this place to my enemiesthe only reason they get one star is cause i can't give them negative stars i will never go there again hope they close soon and put something better in it's place,negative
iOFbMitGdfU6i5xm4nZ8Ww,was really excited to try this place after reading the reviews unfortunately due to really poor service i didn't get to try any of the food sat down with my family and waited over 20 minutes for our server to come take our order when i saw someone who came in 10 minutes later order their food before us we got up and left it sucks to have wasted part of my day at this place,negative
MuJBELBk9VXJjH0tryDh1w,horrid just incredibly disappointing all of it  i love the menu the place music the part that matters the food is just a total miss well except the popcorn here's a thought get a drink and some popcorn and skip the food i ordered the guacamole it was way over salted and preprepared it takes a minute to make guacamole i couldn't eat it i sent it back and since we had chips ordered salsa there is a guajilo sauce too salty and a fresh pico salsa that sat so long the onions ruined it there's a way to avoid this but i'm not going to tell them since the waitress admitted everything is heavily salted and not for everyone  really  it's just bad cooking and a bad attitude i had the chicken enchiladas snooze fest overbaked dry and boring needed a lot more sauce overpriced it should come with a side  it's just cheese tortillas and chicken  love enchiladas hated these i wouldn't come back if it were free,negative
PIDDKHCx_cF-13w9Wi9-2g,i love chipotle but the food prep and service sucks at this location they are really sloppy when preparing your food today they barely have me any rice chicken and beans then loaded up my taco with salsa the whole bottom of my basket was filled with salsa water if you have the time your better off driving 10 minutes to the chipotle in doylestown where the food is always on point,negative
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,my husband has been wanting to try this place forever i've always talked him into something else bc i was afraid this was just a greasy pit  turns out it was everything i expected  if you're in the mood for grease this is the place for you,negative
D73evJ9PZKxO3E5TaThe3w,i didn't eat here just stopped for a drink but i have to put them in the hall of shameful bartending for this experience i ordered a tom collins the first bartender says that's vodka and bitters right he asks another bartender who nods his head yep exactlyi can understand the first guy maybe it was a hectic lunch rush we all get confused from time to time but the second guy obviously he had no idea what the drink was why try to fake it did he think i'd have no idea what was in the drink i just ordered a tom collins is basically gin and lemonade it's one of the most classic popular cocktails if you're gonna work as a bartender at least learn the basicshey maybe the food is good i don't know if you're gonna drink here you might want to stick with the premade margarita mix,negative
gkFi3xoDAtWSyJ3v8H5Atg,service is awful even on a slow night came here on 42219 at around 745pm a monday there was no host stood around for about 5 minutes without being greeted we seated ourselves after grabbing a menu and silverware after someone finally said just choose a seat after we seated ourselves we then waited 20 minutes we finally decided to get up and go next door to the italian food place the funny thing is as we stood up and walked out another couple asked if we were their serverwe replied noadvised were going nextdoor because service sucksavoid this place,negative
y4PxSBhFPrJ2TGaaCLh1RQ,we went for lunch yesterday and my husband was violently ill by 1am vommiting and diarrhea all night and still sick the next day he had the carne asada tacos some rice and beans i ate some rice and chicken enchiladas and almost got sick through the night and still queasy his tacos and the beans are the only thing he ate differently from the rest of our family all day we're not afraid of hole in the wall places but this was a mistake this place needs a visit from the health dept asap see other 1  2 star reviews,negative
naLdPZBHOeC2id4WVSoigA,ordered a blackberry mojito that tasted like sprite mixed with diet fruit syrup don't understand how this restaurant is named al pastor when they don't actually offer al pastor tacos instead it's a slab of very dry pork belly with a little bit pineapple sprinkled on top i usually avoid leaving bad reviews but i just have never been so disappointed in my food like i have with my experience here hope they can improve if you are looking for good authentic tacos this is definitely not the place,negative
LZzDvgfpkd4nI3E4L9wF1w,the tamales were mushy the ground beef taco was odd because it was a salty hamburger patty not actual ground beef  my husband's chimichanga did not taste good either  the tortilla was tough to cut through also  would not recommend this place,negative
jyMDwalzMA7xcETWrQpOqw,carne asada burrito big  filling imo the carne asada was overcooked for my liking as well as a little more fat then i personally preferi like on the lean side with fat trimmed salsa's were good and the overall place was clean and nice,negative
3CxX8mjTBc5j_MZswR0QZA,i've gotten 3 take out orders here this year never againwe typically get 2 separate enchilada meals there isn't even one breasts' worth of chicken meat in both orders the tortillas are hard on each end and there is barely any cheese melted on top we get the sauces on the side as we don't want them swimming in ittheir beans and rice have so much seasoning in them that they taste like they came out of a box their 9 queso order is tiny and is spotty tasting from order to orderall this for a nearly 40 fee where they guilt you into a tip for restaurant workers participation in a pickup order really how about you pay them a living wage you're charging me enough to pay them all 20hourif you're looking for good mexican food this joint isn't it they have really gone downhill since the pandemic hit small portions for big bucksthree strikes yer out chuy's never again,negative
vcFQGtE8M5h7YkkX50BH6w,a surfthemed mexican place that doesn't serve fish tacos or beer what's the point,negative
F23zFNnWhIjh3EPx2vr-pw,nice casual atmospheregreat service pretty decent tacos no better than what you can get farther down charlotte for 12the margaritas were some of the best i've had in nashville behind rosepepper and local tacothe price pretty absurd33 for 3 small but meaty tacos a very very small salad and an even smaller serving of rice and two small margaritasyeah i'm sure it was midrange tequila and fine ingredients but this is still street food and tequilai'll stick to my local holes in the wall unless someone else is buying,negative
7-cy4Gphx_pd5YElcA6Ocw,i have eaten at this chipotle many times over the past year since moving to the area over half of pickup or delivery orders are either missing tortillas dressing the wrong meat etc i've complained though the app and have received reassurance from corporate they would address the issues with this store months after these discussion with corporate still over half of my orders are incorrect much for upper management to address at this location ps love chipotle possibly try a different location,negative
HoCO8CHjAPZWP4P2PoTcZg,ick i didn't realize that i didn't write a review  seriously we ate here a while ago but this place is bad  the food is terrible along with the service  i am amazed that the doubletree is associated with itsorry to give them such bad review but there is a reason  even the easy things like fries were just ick,negative
hA03QM1dEu5DLU0TB9rx4g,i've given this place 4 tries which is 4 too many the food has always been terrible and still is the margarita i had today was premade and horrible i ended up not even drinking the margarita and just getting a beer the best part about this place is the staff and the location they've been pretty friendly also the decor is neat overall i don't see myself ever coming back,negative
q16UE_FA0cC2aSTfm3AlJA,besito has many great things to offer its customers unfortunately a great meal is not one of them the decor and ambience is inviting and enjoyable however the quality of the fish and chicken left a lot to desired my initial dish the rock fish special came out looking less than appetizing the fish was not fresh and tasted horrible my second dish was a salad with grilled chicken the chicken was rubbery and inedible after that i decided to enjoy a liquid dinner consisting of vodka our waitress was very nice and attentive but food was no beuno they gave us a traditional worry doll however all i am worrying about is whether or not i get food poisoning,negative
pzYjWGtDZtzNiU7-Kwoebw,i thought the food was way overpriced and nowhere near the quality of pancheros or chipotle the girl who was taking our orders acted annoyed and had absolutely no patience or time to answer any questions even though we told her it was the first time we'd eaten there no there wasn't a line behind us the man checking us out had no personality either and also acted annoyed when we 'added' a drink even though we had already ordered it and he was asking if we wanted anything else,negative
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,i love the atmosphere however the food quality could def be improved upon nowadays healthy local is the way to go i would just like to see some more organic local farmer's market options and would be happy to pay more the location is so lovely and ppl will happily pay more for it so why not make the food up to that standard other than that it's perfect for kids bday's,negative
XVFUNtPWYpxhoWPtBQHFdQ,i am a doordash driver even before covid hit this restaurant was unprofessional their customer service for delivery drivers is an absolute joke i can no longer keep quiet about their practices with delivery i have spoken with them a dozen times about having deliver drivers prepare customers drinks and they still refuse to fix this today was the last straw i informed them i am not authorized to prepare drinks and was berated by another employee about it being in my contract to do it it is not in my contract i am not an employee of cafe rio i am not on their payroll it is absolutely not my job to fill drinks for customers technicalities aside it is unsanitary i know that my hands are clean but they don't and i can guarantee that there are drivers without clean hands i like most drivers sanitize my hands in my car by the time i am receiving food i've already touched my car my keys my phone and the door to the store there is no telling how many germs i've picked up in that 30 second span from my car to the counter it is unacceptable to be having non employees prepare any part of a customers meal,negative
wA6ziPhpg1J94sL2BZshtQ,my smart husband decided to bring me to this restaurant to try it out and i did not like it at all first of all no substitutions and they charge to share plus it's 50cents to take food to go  the food is average but you might as well just stay home and cook the prices are ridiculous my opinion is either stay home and cook or go to cracker barrel the food is better and it's the same price waste of money and time,negative
ETvEP_n0ogJO4Wcsj-FW1g,usually i am a moe's fan but tonight i was disappointed i ordered online which i believe to be my mistake i feel you need to go through the line and watch them make your order in order to get it correct the serving size was unusually skimpy and i was missing ingredients including guacamole and sour cream for over 8 i felt ripped off i may have to try chipotle next time,negative
T6pMNyBC9ouFV2Msdvybgw,this chipotle is awful i absolutely love chipotle but this particular one is terrible when i got there they were out of fajita veggies chicken barbacoa and large drink cups to combat running out of anything else they apparently decided to just give half to 34 portions to everyone but charge the same price i'm not joking my chip bag had maybe 20 chips in it my guac container was half full and my burrito bowl was the skimpiest bowl i ever saw i had been traveling all day and was tired and hungry and had walked to chipotle from my hotel so i sucked it up and just left with my meager portions  never again,negative
t0Qyogb4x--K9i5b0AoDCg,sorry  this is gringo mexican food  other than salty  the food has no flavor the carnitas tacos were super salty and the spanish rice tasted like the plastic fork  plate i was using   pinto beans were equally boring  i would have to compare taco maya to subway,negative
Y9fhmJvqKpoLuThAiLC12A,i don't like writing bad reviews it's just not my style everyone has an off day i don't like to harp on people for it but my experience at el molinito was the worst dining ever to start i walk in and the host is gabbing with his friend who appears to not work there he does not look at me doesn't say anything until i walk right up to him and say 2 please he points to a table and says that ok doesn't walk us to it doesn't bring us menus nothing we sit and are brought chips and salsa and i have to ask for a menu now let me stop here because the chips and salsa are great and the margaritas are also excellent so we order our food and it comes out quickly the waitress only brings one side of rice and forgot the guacamole ok no big deal i'll ask her when she comes back right except she doesn't come back for 25 minutes we sit and eat waiting for the rest of our order no drink refills no nothing finally i snag another waiter and ask for a refill he attempts to cover for his coworker by saying they are short a waiter today that may be but if that is the case she shouldn't have been standing literally 4 feet behind me chatting with the host and his friend so i pack up what was left of my food chicken burrito which was delicious and decided maybe next time i will get take out before i leave i use the restroom big mistake it looks like it hasn't been cleaned in months and smells like sewage i get home and heat up my burrito for dinner take one bite and bite down on a chicken bone a bone if that's not bad enough i picked apart the rest of it and found 2 more bones thank god a child wasn't eating this they could have choked and died i used to think this place had great food but bad service but after this never again never,negative
qXkrrQPVesVxJwEfhFYH2g,i ordered online for pickup but when i came home i found a small rice bowl instead of a chicken burrito bowl not even any pinto beans uneven amounts of cheese and sour cream i reached out to corporate last month  but still no response i will skip ordering online to avoid another rice bowl marked up price wise to the cost of a filled chicken bowl,negative
qIzKtmOjBC3CSMmPQ068ew,this place be total crap man the service sucked and the employees were rude and ratchet if i had a dime for every person ripped off at this store i'd be livin like drake you know what i'm sayin,negative
A_AEG20YPuVW7Ao7gkHicg,so not worth the money i dont know how it gets so many good reviews tacos ate way over rated and over priced was suprised by that because alot of younger people who cant afford alot to eat out were there oh well we won't be going back again,negative
9w-LZEkP1hf363G-OYvKDg,here it is taco tuesday yelp states they are open until 9pm drove 21 miles and find them closed at 809pm nice job folks,negative
kUP8plrgTC5f4-pQi-kvFg,we visited this location on 5221 not sure where to start the place is filthy dirty the counters tables floors windows and bathrooms not forgetting the trash blowing around the patio the bathroom was beyond a health hazard there was no sign of a cleaning in quite some time the toilet was something i've never seen before the sink beyond disgusting as well the floor had not been swept or correctly mopped in who knows when there were signs of mop marks on the floor obviously with a filthy mop there was not a clean spot to sit in the entire place the floors are filthy the windows haven't been cleaned in recent times the forks are behind the counter and the same lady who takes the cash grabs your fork and hands it to you so my point is how can the food and work areas be what they should be let alone during this pandemic is the food handled properly in this dirty restaurant i called to speak to the manager and basically his concern was how often i had been there obviously one too many times,negative
HfBbWcInRhJWJp9gJYXk4w,they are close to my apartment and open 24 hours so i decided to give them a try hoping to have them become a favorite but far from itthe meat was so fatty it grossed me out and i had to stop eating my burrito  i wish i could at least say something good about the flavor but it was very forgettablethe lady who took my order was extremely friendly though,negative
434A83c2ig6QxsZjrjclpQ,i have been to this deplorable place twice and both times someone from our dinner party got sick i went last might with some friends and the two people that ate the shrimp had it come back up from both ends i am calling the health department tomorrow and lodging a complaint do not eat the shrimp or anything else that they serve,negative
pc8D9b_rnL_I8ak91tKjsg,probably one of the worst meals i've ever had  my friend had fish tacos i had mushroom tacos  mine tasted like what i imagine a shoe would taste like  hers was slightly better but not worth it  my tummy an hour later was killing me went to the bathroom and someone had thrown up all over by the men's bathroom entrance  definitely not going back,negative
QMqKP01SpDXesh7xYUO5Cg,i stopped i for lunch after a friend told me it was good but i wasn't very impressed with this place the steak burrito bowl was a little on the small side and was kind of bland i'm not a big fan of chipotle sauce but had to use it to give it some type of flavor i feel like this place is trying to be like qdoba or chipotle but a lesser quality there are much better food places in the area,negative
3099DXseHIHegyxhYteITQ,if i could give this place no stars i would i am always up for trying new things and i understand that not all things are for everybody i know that i will come across restaurants that are not my favorite but this place had food that was practically inedible i ordered the fajitas and the meat tasted like the meat that comes in frozen tv dinners it was terrible the fajitas were also covered in some terrible sauce and the tortillas were hard and flavorless the only thing worse than the food was the service one entrée came out wrong and mine the fajitas was missing the beans and rice normally that is not an issue and i would just ask the server but our server only came back to our table once during our dining experience and she didn't look at anybody grabbed some empty glasses and ran off  when we were done eating she finally came back and sat there and talked to us about random stuff for a long time at that time we just wanted to get out of there this was hands down the worst dining experience i have ever had in both food and service,negative
6F-6mFFNw2YXN7lD_Gukcg,perhaps the manager and the staff were having a bad day but this establishment does not live up to its hype  i do not enjoy my margs being served with a large side of attitude which is all we got there  proceed with caution,negative
xfoQquijuSs6SdI76DpFfQ,way over priced  measuring contents for a 12 margarita is crazyembarrassing,negative
H5Rk-aunuEzGANXCBu-NPQ,food was good but steak was small and overcooked brought friends this time and was super embarrassed that the service sucked so bad we were trapped without drinks wrong drinks at that we got outta there as fast as we could i think the servers name was yesenia but i didn't bother with it on the way out there were three hostesses at the front and they didn't say a damn thing and that was how my friendship with miguel's ended all abruptly like never to be spoken of again,negative
tszRCO-RchPXPZlsTCYgbA,sat for 30 min without water sat another 90 minutes after ordering food arrived but was mediocre at best table top was not very clean when we sat down very disappointing esp since we brought out of town friends for authentic mexican,negative
w2KlUmMTw9leo_4kYq95hg,this location's staff could use some training in customer service when you walk up to the counter the employee just stared at us rather then saying how can i help you then after each item i ordered they would say is that it lady at checkout was nice though,negative
YPqEm4opPLuO0A6ZJeJfGw,the owner has been very arrogant to my wife and to me although we were longtime customers since they were newdo not confuse the attitude here with that in los sarapes in ambler which is quite warm and welcoming,negative
y36s2lDcimRho8sh73UYFg,i don't understand reviews are all so good that i stopped here after a day at the beach    i picked a table by the windowaand that was a huge mistake there was a big gross smear the size of a dinner plate   on the window at eye level  the table was not clean just wiped with visible steaks and water marks so i felt like i was sitting in a petri dish but the reviews were good so i waited it out the food arrived and was very generous portion the chicken was better than average the rice was not even warm and tasted like nothing  so i probably would not have stopped agsinhowever 14 minutes after leaving before i got even home i had to pull into a walgreens to use the restroom any place that gives me diarrhea 15 minutes later deserves a call to the health department not my business ever agsin do not go here,negative
v-tpo1lc5o16rm6RigborA,usually really good food and service today only 13 full took 15 minutes to get my salad and shrimp way undercooked used to love this place  took shrimp back no one seemed to care,negative
sUcHRcT9BzEP0yJX7t9RQw,just moved across the country to palm harbor and saw an ad that moe's just opened here  i downloaded the app and they offered free queso for just one week after signing up  so i tried to get there tonight to check it out but due to nonstop drenching storms there were flood advisories put out for palm harbor and i don't know the area yet and do not know how the flooding works here so decided queso wasn't worth risking my life for  i called moe's to explain and asked if they could please extend the offer one day due to the flood advisories  the manager said no  nice real nice  not very neighborly and definitely not the lovely southern hospitality that i've experienced elsewhere in the area  crossed that place off my list of places to check out,negative
5xDQFNAlW5WalnfqOvUxBQ,this place was nasty food was awful smelled weird please save your money took forever to have our food ready,negative
14QP5lOdrTAVVCDDuHIAUg,main issue  way over priced 32 for 12 tamales give me a break we were running late this year and didn't have time to make our own tamales and didn't want to impose at the last minute on our goto tamale lady and we traditionally have red chile tamales on christmas eve so i said no problem the reviews for tucson tamale co have been good and i'll pick up a dozen expecting to pay maybe 20 or even 25 santa cruz tamales were ok i've had way better sook  but 32 next year we'll revert to making our own better tasting and they don't feel like a ripoff,negative
u_0e1X9whtdIBURmiQCv_A,skip this place unless you are in a drunken pinch downtown  well flavored food and cool atmosphere the primary drawback is that this is an establishment that offers very small amounts of real food while trying to satiate its customers with cheap filler basically they take advantage of their customers if you want this style of food you are much better off actually going to chipotle,negative
cN4Y09a7clgjFd1tY-wSZw,first off we waited forever to get seated second off we waited for our food for approximately an hour and a half third off our eight entrees are cold forth off sarah found a hair in her food fifth off our orders were not correct and one of our entrees took an extra 15 minutes to come out sixth off our friend who's birthday we are here for did not revive a song or sombrero upon asking when we first arrived over all experience was terrible,negative
LfbZwPNiLKnCUxRQAE2uWg,i was very unimpressed with this place as was my husband my enchiladas were soggy and had little to no flavor with the smallest amount of chicken stuffed in them his burrito was also soggy like the tortillas were not cooked enough i would not recommend this place but hopefully anyone else dining here has a better experience,negative
RqW9S4WG9UYZHKhHRHXJZg,this place used to be good  lost it quality control as the business grew amazing tacos almost impossible to get don't think about going on lunch break never going to happen place is always packed sad i'm giving what was such a great place one star,negative
FZCj995CEL2G-JTiLC3Azw,my food wasn't right  the lobby was dirty and the staff messed up the order behind me  a trained goat could run a better taco bell  not going back in the near future,negative
XOZ4BlYb2jYuTpL6AJMUsg,i'm so disappointed i really wanted to love this place since it is walking distance from my home my husband hated his food he ordered the chicken burrito supposed to be a cheese enchilada with it but received a chicken enchilada instead i ordered the cheese enchilada tostado and beef taco but received the chicken taco the chicken taco was so full of onions i couldn't palate it it was definitely an onion taco my tostadas was a disgusting eye sore that looked like vomit i have never seen something so horrifying served on a plate from a restaurant please throw some lettuce tomato  maybe a cute little swirl of sour cream you're welcome the queso dip was one of the best we ever had,negative
2CrM7eYAT_vnEQnd2zTf6Q,i was so excited to be reunited with hacienda as it used to be a favorite luncheon for me and my high school buddies sadly i was rather disappointed with the entire experiencethe chips and salsa that you can also purchase at schnuck's seemed to be lacking the chips were over done and greasy and the salsa had chunks of unidentifiable ingredients mehwe took a few minutes to order and had to ask the server to come back he took us quite literally and didn't reappear for awhile i ordered a margarita but he never asked me what kind i wanted  frozen or on the rocks salt or unsalted top shelf or rail when we finally ordered our food 45 minutes went by before we could finally flag down our server and inquire about the delay it was a monday at lunchtime and hardly busy enough to take 45 minutes he went to ask the kitchen about the hold up everyone around us had arrived after we ordered and were finished eating he returned to tell us that they were out of shrimp we ordered shrimp fajitas and that they had sent someone to the grocery store to pick some up a brief apology but no other mention was very unprofessional i think that after waiting an hour for shrimp fajitas maybe a manager would stop by to say something or they would have asked us if we wanted to order something else i mean most of the patrons were business professionals on a lunch break such as my date we paid full price and left a good tip but you can bet i won't be back in a rush  so disappointed,negative
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,as we walked into this chipotle i went to the restroom while my daughter waited in line when i came back she told me that one of the employees pointed at her while talking to another employee and laughed we ordered our food and as we were next to pay the cashier walked away she walked to the back and we saw her talking to another employee for several minutes while our food was getting cold not the kind of service we are used to at chipotle at all,negative
RM8JlmXz8hujhcUZIyyg8g,there are lots of better options in doylestown the vegetariano burrito was mushy and not very appealing with lots of a ranchlike dressing that wasn't listed in the menu description or i would have skipped it the salsa bar seemed interesting but everything i tried except the pico de gallo was unappetizingly gelatinous and seemed like generic food service products was sorry to find the food so disappointing as the location is convenient and the restaurant is open quite late,negative
UtABCTNWNw19ilPS5USErw,just don't go here the food is good cause it's jack in the box but the employees don't care about making people wait hoping this building gets shut down soon,negative
zwuSlh7ky7xWIK0yhD47JQ,i think this is my first and probably last 1star review but the tacos here were so gross i couldn't eat them the corn tortillas were stale and the meat tasted off plus this is expensive for tacos i dropped 15 on 2 tacos chips  guac and a diet coke not worth it for food i ended up throwing out,negative
pQxBmSd1F_SRXIy4CwKlyQ,my husband and i have just finished our takeout lunch from jalapenos grill and we both agreed that everything we had was edible but completely bland and immemorable i honestly don't think i will ever eat here again especially since there are many more exciting options in the area we had chips and salsa a shrimp quesadilla and a chicken a beef and a carnitas taco all on a soft corn tortilla the chips seemed like bagged ones not freshly fried but i could be wrong they were certainly lacking salt and any flavor and were just eh the salsa was thin and had no discernible onion cilantro or chopped tomato it tasted like pureed canned tomato with a touch of dried herbs and maybe some jalapeno pickling liquid for flavor it was less than eh the quesadillas had yellow shredded cheddary cheese and some sort of chilipowder sprinkle it was not only tasteless but oddly overwhelmed the flavor of the onions and peppers which were included the peppers and onions tasted as if they were cooked en masse the night before refrigerated and reheated as needed chopped up bits of them almost flavorless the shrimp were obviously given a cook through on the grill they were thin flaccid and just there this was served with the same hohum salsa sour cream and guacamole which to me did not seem to be freshly made i love guacamole and i barely touched it onto my husband's tacos  one of each meat as i said he said all three tasted the same  like nothing in particular underseasoned cooked through meat shredded iceberg lettuce yellow shredded cheese he ate them but was unimpressed he left the tortilla chips said he had zero interest in them i'm just glad i didn't order the horchata because i don't want my love of it to be spoiled by blandness honestly if you want better mexican go down the street to la guadalupana tortilla press heck even chipotle any of these beats the pants off jalapenos i can't imagine this place will develop a loyal clientelei give it two stars because it wasn't horrible  just more meh than pretty much any place i've ever been,negative
bzO826Hw3DCuQ5xl3OEP7Q,have you ever known that having a good meal would soon be difficult to come by so you have the opportunity on your last day for a few to have something you love this was my situation when i decided to go to el fuego today  i went yesterday  i'm getting my last 2 wisdom teeth removed so i decided to have one of my favorite foods ever a vegetarian burrito instead of going to one of my usual places i yelped burritos and saw that el fuego was around the corner i went in  it happened to be happy hour which meant 2 chips  guac  which was actually terrible the chips were lackluster and the guacamole was missing something the burrito was ok they don't know how to wrap a burrito so it doesn't close properly i stood in line was asked the type of beans i wanted and then the girl behind the counter just decided that i of course wanted chicken so that's what she gave me so i said i didnt ask for chicken she said  you don't want chicken i said no so she said sorry what kind of burrito you want i said vegetarian and you know she had the nerve to try the chicken off the tortilla and make me a vegetarian burrito with that then i had to tell her i dont eat meat and even if i did that's not acceptable  at that point you'd think i'd cut my losses and walk out but for some reason i did not ha i get to the end the guy says for here or to go i say to go because i knew i wasn't going to eat the entire thing so i wanted a bag i then ordered a strawberry margarita the guy who you pay said we only make the margaritas for eat in customers i said i am eating in and he said oh i thought you said to go blah blah he got all pissy because he couldnt understand why someone would want a bag it was mediocre 4 frozen eh not bad i'll get over it  in general their service is terrible their prices are cheap and their food is mediocre at best none of those are reasons for me to go back,negative
Rr879Enz9h1J3tRXXb1KDg,sigh my favorite part of the experience was how fast our food came out that was enough for me i was sold  then let down the margarita was trash  i'm pretty sure there wasn't any alcohol in it i was hungry  didn't feel like complaining so whatever i ordered chicken flautas which were good but i've had better my friend ordered a shrimp chimichanga and got a stomach ache right after eating the service started off great but rapidly declined we're just trying to find a good spot close to home ‍,negative
wzPc5d1l0PpxQLQDhh8T2w,we came in and were told it would be a 30 minute wait for food here there looked to be about 8 people working in the kitchen and the place wasn't horribly busy for a wait that long they didn't seem to have very much hustle in the back which probably explains the excessive wait the cashier said it would be a better idea to call in and order ahead on the weekends what kind of taco place takes 30 minutes to make food i've seriously stood in lines at disneyland for a shorter period of time when the food finally did arrive the staff member that brought it over was rather rude and didn't seem like she wanted to be there they just dropped the food on the table without saying a wordthe food was ok but nothing special i got the original burrito and it was kinda dry not worth waiting around for 30 minutes for it honestly would have been better if it wasn't soured by a ridiculous wait and rude staff won't be making this mistake again,negative
QLUUaTj034zYVWiVl9tNvA,me and my brother stopped by here rather serendipitously we were in new orleans on a weekend vacation and were on our way to find another location so there we were at lafayette square and couldn't find our original choice cause they had moved and found this place instead we liked the look of the menu so we stopped in      the food was absolutely sublime i had the brioche french toast served with peach compote and toasted pecans with it i had a side of hashbrown casserole my friend had the andouille sausage benedict served with a crawfish hollandaise he also had the hashbrown casserole as previously stated the food was phenominal although maybe a touch high price wise our dishes were 11 and 13 respectively even still the quality of the food would certainly justify the price for some people for me it did      if you are a new orleans resident or like me a visitor on vacation you should check this place out,positive
c7dC_fiXquGaWXyLcENyaw,we were very impressed with emory wood fired the ambience is great and it looks very upscale on the inside all the staff were very pleasant and we even got a free birthday dessert that was fantastic the food we ordered a taleggio  pear pizza as well as a spicy sausage pizza the taleggio cheese was absolutely incredible and the spicy sausage was possibly even better the chef visited our table and told us the origin of both pizzas and how he was inspired to make those exact recipes the dessert we got a free chocolate torte for dessert and it was delicious it had a tangy goat cheese topping on it that made it a very interesting but yummy treat overall for a birthday dinner we came away feeling very happy we choose emory,positive
9Ys1CvuL7GFwRdhudvWWfQ,after brunching here last weekend the only disappointment i left with was the fact that i hadn't tried it sooner i ordered the crab cakes eggs benedict which came in a huge portion size and was incredibly rich while not being over the top and delicious the eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns on the side were some of the best i've ever had i also ordered the specialty flavor coffee of the day which was french vanilla  i'd definitely order it again this is a new goto for me,positive
ghFNIv9_Bde6uquScRZD7g,little baby's is right next to pizza brain in fact you can walk right from the pizza store in to the ice cream store you have to be brave to eat from here the ice creams taste great the flavors are unique i really fell in love with the oatmeal raisin flavor they make their own ice cream the pizza flavor really really taste like pizza and it's good the set up is cute both stores is nostalgic,positive
fuMYz11sdGwFqckMu0BkGQ,i was sooooo pleasantly surprised by our group of 5's dinner yes  try it for dinner  less crowded than the lunch rush at a huge table that can seat 7 or 8 in the dtown panera fairly new locationwhile prices are a bit high for cafe style fast food  the soups and breads are tasty if not caloric and our 8 year old loved the 11 shrimp sandwich plus  somebody's gotta wash the real nowls and flatware they serve on this is not a saladworkssome items took a long time to come out  but were worth the waitwe'll be back for sure,positive
Y1QKeVZSvhnAZnO26SK6QQ,i frequently shop at nordstrom and decided to try the nordstrom grill for the first time today  it's a great place for lunch a little on the pricey side but the food was very good  we were seated immediately which is very rare at noon in green hills and the service was great  i had the chicken paillard salad and my friend had the crispy chicken sandwich  both dishes were very tasty and priced around 13  nordstrom grill is a great alternative to the cheesecake factory which is always busy and loud  prices are similar and the food is a little better in my opinion,positive

Mzmt8AvZOExG_4h3MMlihg,i tried the refinery this week during restaurant week  they offered the prix fixe menu for 25 which i felt was a good bargain  i opted for the vegan menu which was very delicious and friend went cow all the way  i had to try the beef tongue and i can say that as a mostlyvegetarian it was really delicious  i just couldn't think too much about what i was actually eating  the atmosphere is very cool reminded me of a hip place up north with the wood floors and the bar on the second floor i will definitely put this place on my list to goto restaurants especially since they change the menu every week,positive
TSIQyKAgz3pwIBQisP1aBg,after having a beer at one of the local breweries my boyfriend and i stopped here for a late sunday afternoon lunch we were in the mood for a good burger and goodness did stock  barrel deliver i think what sealed the deal for my boyfriend was when he saw duck fat fries on the menu our waiter was great he was very responsive to checking in on us to make sure all was well to even offering up little tidbits that one wouldn't know unless someone told them ie getting half fries and half onion rings with a burgerand not paying an additional fee my boyfriend was even able to get the duck fat fries with his burger although there was a small upcharge for those our burgers were delicious and huge their burger options on the menu was very extensive i'd definitely like to try out some othersthe inside decor was really cool all of the walls were made of different materials yet they all had that industrial look and they all melded together quite well overall we both enjoyed our meal and have said we'd like to come back to stock  barrel,positive

4yKv0SEpuJDHECFinhifWQ,i went in around 5 pm on friday  once you enter there is a door to the right leading to the lounge area and another door to the left leading to the restaurant   the staff seems limited but friendly  i ordered the chicken sandwich with fries   it only took a short time to get the order and came to 950  overall the food is good  good sized sandwich and a decent amount of thicker fries  the only problem i have is the cost  i can see paying about 7 but not close to 10,positive

y7IeWfRxjuC4dCsvmXZOYA,this is a true diamond in the rough   if it was located anywhere more 'hip' ie mass ave fountain squarefletcher place warehouse district this place would be packed to the gills   as it is it's located kind of in a black hole   there's a pizza place across the street and an ethiopian restaurant a block away   the central library is just around the corner   otherwise that's about it   it's located on a pretty busy street pennsylvania avenue that goes downtown but i bet most morning commuters don't even know there's a restaurant on the first floor of this apartment buildingthis location has been a couple things in my day   it was supposed to be a cajuncreole place by the founder of yat's but plans with his partner fell through and it became the bar at the ambassador   that didn't last too long and then it was some kind of fancy mexican restaurant which was even more shortlived   now it is the plow  anchor   i had heard good things about the place when it opened but then it kind of fell off my radari came early on a thursday evening i'm in this part of town to watch amateur boxing from early march through late april and other than a guy on his laptop at the bar and a couple at one table in the dining room i was the only customer   there was no hostess working so i asked the bartender if i could sit in the dining room as i was meeting someone for dinner and she doesn't like sitting on backless bar stools   the guy at the bar looked up from his laptop and said i've got this        i guess he knew the bartender or worked herehe grabbed a couple menus and took me to the dining room and asked if i wanted a fourtop so we would have more room   i asked if that was ok because i didn't want to take up more seating than necessary if they were going to be busy later   he just laughed and said nohe brought a drink menu and asked what i wanted   i looked it over and noticed that they had a draft beer from bent rail brewery    i thought that was unusual because the last time i was at bent rail they didn't have any of their house beers ready they were pouring beers from other local microbreweries    the guy then went into a lengthy explanation of the brewing process there and had intimate knowledge of the facility   maybe he's just a beer aficionado   there's something familiar about this guythen it dawned on me   he's the chefowner and was involved at bent rail and the local in westfield   i've seen his picture in countless magazines and newspaper articles   he's kind of a celebrity chef in this townmy dining companion arrived shortly therafter and our waitress promptly took our order   we started with the tuna poke and split the burger and brussel sprouts   the tuna was sublime   it was a very simple raw preparation with white sesame seeds and shoyu soy sauce but it was just about perfect  they use barrelaged shoyu which makes all the difference in the worldthere's only one burger on the menu and with good reason  it's the only burger you'll ever want to have   it's just ground beef everton cheese an indiana cheese made in connersville which is similar to a gruyere   if you order this please don't put ketchup on this burger because the caper aioli adds just the right amount of saltiness and moisture to every bitethe brussel sprouts also had an asian twist to them as they are fried with chili paste and soy sauceif you have been to the local you also know that it is very gastropubby   it has a distinct warehouse feel tall unfinished ceilings exposed support columnsbeams and concrete floors      the plow  anchor can also only be classified as a gastropub but in a completely different way   think 'upscale' without being snooty     you would feel as comfortable dining here in jeans and a tshirt as you would wearing a 3piece suitit's a shame that my annual boxing ritual is ending in a couple weeks as i have just discovered this place for my prefight watering hole   perhaps i'll just have to make the trip downtown more often,positive

VRGYwKE_Z77frm5NwLvJhw,to be fair  this review is influence by alcohol  prior during and after  so many upscale burger joints out there now so how to separate  how about a fairly simple menu  you don't need fifty kinds of burgers  i think burger republic had twelve or so  have tots  tots make everything better  serve tots with cheese  cheese makes tots even more better  have beer  again you don't need one hundred taps but burger republic had about thirty but they had a fantastic mix of beers  interesting heavy light and only three ipa's  cuz' guess what  you don't have to have half your selections be ipa's  and they four octoberfest choices  four  and not one was pumpkin not that there is anything wrong with pumpkin beer  so we sit down  order victory festbier very nice and the tots fondue  a four cheese bowl of melty cheese with a mount of perfectly crisp tots  they were destroyed in minutes remember the mention of alcohol earlier  on to the burgers  i was accompanied by a gentleman from boston  we are in nashville  and they have a flippin' fenway burger  are you kidding me  so of course he got and said it was great  i opted for the 96 burger at the recommendation of our helpful bartender but did the split with another friend on the oktoburger  they were both great  especially given that we were in full munchie mode by that point  cold sober i could breakdown the various flavors going on and look forward to returning and experiencing the burgers in a more coherent state  but for a late night drunk burger there is nothing better on the planet  all hail burger republic  i salute you,positive
i_FWONQD1ZBqrNE2b-M5Ug,a must tryi made reservations for a sunday night and was surprised to see the place packed at 6pm  this is a starr restaurant and i didn't expect anything less from the decor as i made my way over to our tablewe ordered the master collection cheese plate 2 appetizers an entree and a few cocktailsthen followed by a dessert  everything tasted greatno complaints about the food and i can almost be certain that other items on the menu will be just as goodthe bottom line  this is one of those places where you'll want to reserve in advance for a special occasion  food's a little pricey as expected but you're paying for location ambiance and the whole experience  i want to say that this is a romantic setting but the tables were just a tad bit too close together and the noise level was a little above what i wantedno biggie though  i'll definitely come back because everything else made up for it,positive

cQIh4YJlVtZI9TLF5_smOg,i have been going to shaved duck for more than two years and i am proud to say that the quality has not changed i will say that you have to go back and try a couple items until you find the one that gets you hooked  my item of choice is the duck and blue cheese flatbread  served on what looks to be a wooden cutting board it is paper thin crispy crust that is decorated with succulent duck slightly wilted spinach tomatoes crumbles of fresh and tangy blue cheese and drizzled with a sweet bourbon sauce  so good it truly is a party in my mouth the smoked chicken wings are the best bbq item on the menu the smoky flavor and the fall of the bone meat makes this another staple when we visit if you are going to put sauce on these which they don't even need cuz they are that good i would skip the sauce served with the wings and use the one provided on your table in the red ketchup bottle it is a thinner sauce and has just the right kick as for other notable items on the menu i would recommend the duck confit  small appetizer portion but delicious to the last bite  the smothered fries are good but on the heavy side so beware if you get them as an appetizer  unfortunately i was not impressed with their ribs i have had much better at bogart's pappy's or even southtown pub i am not sure if that is a sign for the rest of their bbq but have stuck with the chicken wings and flatbread when i come here beer selection is top notch as well and will not disappoint love that this is a thriving restaurant in my old neighborhood be sure to get their early or be prepared to wait as the inside is small and they don't take reservations,positive
uYMVRPYEqpmVXWN2xOs5KQ,with back to back clients today i needed to grab something quick for lunch i decided to call to order takeout the young lady on the phone was extremely polite and my food was ready as ordered when i arrived i ordered the bbq chicken ranch salad and a cup of the bisque i was pleasantly surprised the salad was outstanding and the bisque was creamy and delicious i will definitely be stopping in tomorrow,positive

AZJpX5slpbZUTU9INbwu0g,i'd been meaning to come to nice guys for a while now and i finally did this past sunday for brunch it was pretty busy which i am glad to see especially now so there was a wait to be seated we saw some people we knew so they allowed us to just be seated with them and not wait they move through the list quickly and are very accommodating check out their instagram page to see different specials they have because it might not be on the menu my suggestion would be to create a cocktail menu because they come up with really creative drinks but they don't have a menu our server bella was really sweet and she was so busy running all her tables so she did her best i had the seafood omelette it was really good everything is seasoned perfectly the shrimp on the shrimp  grits taste like they were cooked in crab boil  very good i think they're doing a good job operating under the current circumstances,positive

PjjShgqNvX5Marv-RJ1oNg,came here with my partner to celebrate valentine's day we didn't make any plans until last minute we were lucky that our first choice of restaurant was open even if it meant setting at the bar the ambience has a feel of a modern yet southern style restaurant the environment was casual but also elegant we got seated right away and our bartenders helped us with our drink orders i decided to the lady j ivory cocktail which was a seasonal and a favorite it was absolutely delicious my partner got a bourbon based cocktail julia sugarbaker which had lavender peach lemon and size  it was delicious as well we weren't that hungry we decided to split our meals we ordered half a chicken and two sides at first my partner was disappointed for he thought it was not going to be enough but it got us full quite fast but we still had room for dessert which is always my favorite part of dinner  we shared the waffle ice cream sandwich with hazelnut and nutella ice cream it was a perfect sharing dessert and a popular one of the night i loved it we order another round of cocktails to end our dinner date i ordered the tipsy arnold palmer with peach vodka and sweet tea it was super tasty but too sugary my partner ordered the road to hinchtown which was another bourbon drink with black pepper ginger beer and lime it was good i highly recommend this place the ambience the people the food and the drinks were all amazing glad to know this new indy restaurant is one of many that originated in new york city,positive

Qw7tz-UkPrpXaVidWuab4Q,i still love the pma i took myself to see the gee's bend exhibit today normally i meander through exhibits on my own but today i decided to take the free guided tour i have to say having a tour guide really made a difference the woman could have been a little more friendly  i felt she was a tad brusque in her answering of questions  but her knowledge of quilting quilt design and the gee's bend aesthetic made up for her demeanor since she had met with the womenartists when they came for the opening of the exhibit so we was able to share all sorts of little bits of stories with us the quilts were absolutely stunning and i'm inspired to break out the sewing machine i really enjoyed the photography mini exhibit at the beginning with intimate portraits of some of the artists the 28 minute documentary at the perelman center was a great addition and another way to meet the quilters i like that the museum continued the exhibit in perelman by adding examples of victorian and amish quilting this is only the second time in my life that i have bought the coffee table book of an exhibit but i was so taken with the gee's bend exhibit that i couldn't resist also there were double discounts for members i also popped into the james castle exhibit which was equally fascinating  once again my membership pays for itself,positive

u7cZUEGK6iJP2gvI22xY2A,this place is the absolute pure manifestation of a gastropub creative and delicious food paired with an outstanding draft selection what more could you want i had a squash and something bisque with walnuts and a something spiced walnut oil the ingredients and preparation were so non standard that i can't even remember what they were exactly but amazingly good i also had the jackfruit cakes with roasted peanuts and the hefewiesen hummus with pita perfect chips and deep fried chick peas did you read that i said deep fried chick peas mmmm my main was the swiss chard covered mac and cheese that was sprinkled with pickled onion the chef jesse described the mac and cheese to me this way after 12 bites you will start to not taste the cheese any more so the pickled onions will reset your flavor palette and allow you to taste the cheese for your next 12 bites thereby allowing you to enjoy the dish throughout eating it just like the first taste  so let's dissect this description one the mac and cheese is amazing two the chef knows his stuff employing technical knowhow with creativity and three the mac and cheese is amazingthe beer on draft was delicious i had a bear republic which i always find to be good and a maredsous 6 that was out of this worldfinally the service is great unpretentious knowledgable and friendly what more do you wantnough said,positive

BuQptNNitbz1oylgBlm27g,the absolute worst prime rib ever  i think the cow died of old age  tough stringy  my son got spaghetti with meat sauce except there was no meat waiter was the worst i've had in years  just not a good experience  it was packed however we were here on a tuesday night on an earlier visit and everything was better looks like they just don't do crowds well do not get the prime rib,negative
HW5LkI9qeqVDwHqhd00_8A,unhappy rooster visiting from out of town looked like a cute and cozy spot when we walked by decided to give it a try and walked in and there weren't any bar spots available and all tables had a reserved sign placed on them we were getting ready to walk out when nice customers offered us their seats because they were leaving while we were waiting for the customers to gather their things and leave we noticed a lady serving wine from behind the bar and an officer waiting with a 20 bill out the lady behind the bar serving glasses of wine never said a word to us until after 5 minutes we had been seated at the bar top she said the bartender will be here shortly we continued to wait and finally decided that we were waiting at a place with poor customer service if an officer can't get served within 3 minutes then there's bigger issues at this place too many bar options available in the area to be given poor service,negative
AQw0B8j9QV1RkFLLFiwkuw,this was our first time eating here and the food was okay  maybe it was what we ordered but it wasn't anything special  the coffee cup had coffee stains on it not sure if new or old the table had crumbs but the biggest surprise was the ants  we were finding them on the table in the creamer bowl and even on our faces arms and clothes  gross  after extensive searching we realized they had to be falling from the tarp covering above us we were sitting outside on their patio  as they were fairly busy we couldn't move to another table but mentioned it to every server who stopped at our table who were very attentive and did a good job and they expressed concern saying they would tell the management who never came to check things out for herself  on our way out one of our party mentioned it to the woman in charge and her answer was well that's eating in nature  there's nothing i can do about it  really  how about removing the tarp and fixing the problem since i guess an apology was too much to ask for  this was definitely a onetime visit,negative
WrEUNRWQx0bFBGegyFHDHA,i really wanted to like this place  i'd heard that they brewed some pretty decent beers and that the food was first rate  my wife and i stopped in yesterday around 400 pm the place looked like it was deserted  the building which dates back to the 1700's looks like it has fallen into disrepair  my wife wanted to leave after just seeing the building i convinced her that we should at least try a beer we were the only customers in the place  after talking with one of the brewers we learned that the restaurant side of the business has dropped of dramatically and that in fact they are selling the restaurant and will instead concentrate on brewing  we had a few beers and sandwiches  everything we had was decent nothing really stood out  i hope that after the sale the new owners pump some life back into the place  similarly after the brewers are free of the restaurant and are just brewing beer they will be able to ratchet it up a notch or two  for now i would have to recommend that you pass until the dust settles,negative
znBiWLCwpLGwdrgvZ7G6Hg,some places are probably best left as a part of a song margaritaville for example i spent the entire time i was here looking for my lost shaker of salt and never found it that's a metaphor for something i have no idea what but i'll figure it outhonestly it's not a bad place for a tourist to stop and get a cocktail but this local girl just couldn't enjoy the place the front bar or is it the back bar had a band playing that was way too loud for the room the lead singer must have thought he was playing jackson square or something we seriously had to relocate to get away from it it was that badmargaritas aren't terrible but tons of alcohol doesn't necessarily make a good drink their mixologist needs to know that i didn't try the food but i'm sure it's typical chain faire go in if you are in the neighborhood and need sustenance but there are a lot of better places in the areasome people say that there's a woman to blame i'm that woman i went here and it was my own damn fault,negative
ZGH8MzJa7Q7iIpmtzBAJAQ,the place has a great outdoor view of blacky bridge and the river but as to the clientele not so great,negative
6Pu5MKIWbn6FO-oebSSrYQ,this was a very disappointing meal our steaks arrived before our oysters  we both had a filet served over chives mashed potatoes a simple meal what we got was an undercooked steak on cold potatoes either a few chopped asparagus we informed the waiter who took our plates soon to return with another serving of cold food if i could give negative stars i would in the midst of dinner the lights suddenly went out  to add insult the manager acknowledged that they continue to struggle to provide hot food for the price charged this was by far a total waste of money we will never come back,negative
JrG4NINLspXPNhSXg7Q07Q,absurdly disappointed with this place i thought it'd be a good idea to stop in for a quick dinner since we were in the area and i remembered the name of this place as a good option our waiter wasn't very attentive the food had barely any flavor and the candles where we were placed in the back went out within seconds so we were sitting in the dark confused as to the hype and would certainly not go back there are way better places in the area,negative
mXxNBcU-NWecAlEA3uvyVA,i ordered a cheeseburger and fries so i was surprised to find a bad full of fries only when i got home 5 miles later and 12 dollars later i'll never eat at that location again,negative
u86rWYwiqTDk-c17qorF6w,wrong wrong wrong decision i should have wrote a review the last time i ate there a few months ago and i didn't but today was so no better the food the staff the restaurants in that order iess than impressive me and 2 co workers ordered online for a speedy pick up we were greeted by a young girl in a leopard sleep bonnet that had a i really don't wanna talk to you attitude and that's exactly what we got when she rudely asked us what we wanted there was another girl that was standing in customer view scrolling on her phone our food was old the fries were greasy and too salty and cold the chicken was boneless and tasted like they were cooked earlier and reheated the crust was soggy and my other co worker food was just let me just say we wasted our money we didn't finish our food and we all feel sick to our stomachs,negative
BCPpFA_h3l4F73H7ouLrbQ,trainwreck  that's what this was  taps broke while we were there  we were there for an early drink despite a big night ahead they made no effort to fix them  appetizer was over cooked   not recommended,negative
3SM8CZuY5MiAruczCm556w,service was better the 1st visit this time the waiter was not as attentive and our bowl had 2 huge chips in it very sloppy for a nice restaurant then a party of 18 was set next to us and they were so loud when we asked the waiter about military discount he asked to see both of our id's my husband is military not me however we've never been told the discount is just for one mealwow,negative

xs5gxwXz1QFlWy62XAH-9Q,i return to nukes today after taking our year long hiatus due to excessively high prices i went at 230 so i would assume it would be well past the lunch crowd time but it took over 15 minutes to get my order as much of the people in the back we're working on catering orders when i placed my order for my sandwich i was asked which side i would like i asked which were available and the cashier told me several i picked mac  cheese and then when i got my bill i was shocked to see i was charged 275 extra i stated he did not tell me that it would be extra and i did not want that he called over the manager who said he would void it and asked me which side i would like i asked which sides are included and he told me chips coleslaw and pasta salad i told him i would take chips then i was shocked when i looked at the bill for the second time and was charged for the chips when you're already paying nine dollars for a sandwich i would think chips would be included especially since i asked which were included if you're going to present people with side you should be upfront about the fact that they cost extra,negative
0kEyHYpI6ixtq87LV6I1Aw,we waited about 15 minutes and were never waited on staff didn't even acknowledge us we walked out so unable to comment about food,negative
dIpTuL2T1L98GQGU17IeSw,i enjoyed the ambiance and our server was very nice however my food was inedible i ordered the veggie burger and it was gummy and tasteless it tasted like canned black beans that were mushed formed into a patty and heated without adding any other ingredients bland and just gross if you aren't even going to try to make a decent burger than just carry frozen boca patties as that would be a huge improvement i took my sad sandwich home added a bunch of seasoning and some breadcrumbs for texture and baked it we also ordered hummus and chips and they were ok someone in our party had a severe gluten allergy and they were very accommodating would go back to hang out with friends but wouldn't order food again,negative
zEKvxI5F_j_dBfwRCfQloA,we returned again for brunch to celebrate father's day our waitress was a little slow and unenthusiastic from the get go but we did have the beignets again and they were amazing we ordered our entrees  pancakes biscuits and gravy french toast and an egg omelette everything came out in a timely fashion and we were pleased however my brother in law was 2 bites into his omelette when he spit out a huge piece of glass roughly the size of a quarter we were all highly skeptical of our meals at that point and immediately notified the waitress and the manager they both apologized and took the plate back to investigate the issue they ended up throwing out the entire egg omelette line but did other people already have glass in their eggs too it's a troublesome thought needless to say my brother in law did not want another omelette the general manager was very embarrassed by the situation and did take care of our bill for the whole table he said we could file an incident report but we opted not to he was very empathetic and did the best that he could to accommodate us it's a shame this happened and it is definitely a learning situation for everyone despite the empathy i don't think we will be returning,negative
B2xtWMBTyDtd-ndqqaIC1Q,very disappointed at the poor service my coworkers and i received by brandon especially when the food provided to one of our party wasn't as stated on the menu plain fries provided instead of olive oil parsley fries while the food was good not great the service left a sour taste in our mouths and our company will certainly not be going back anytime soon,negative
w9grvGu-5bHNucOeReHzfA,had high hopes for this place but was let down in every area  well except the decor which is very warm and welcoming  the service was diner quality rushed and unfriendly our waitress  piper was fake friendly and forgot about us most of the time including forgetting a beer i ordered and bringing us the bill quickly to rush us out  the food was okay had i ordered salt with fish on the side  it was so salty that my mouth burned  there were some good food elements but not enough to overcome the oversalted mains  they shuffled us through our meal and had us out the door in under an hour  and when we asked them to call us a cab they said they could not it was against their policy and told us just to walk down the street maybe one would come by  as we were visiting nashville from toronto on our tenth wedding anniversary we were a more then a little let down  boo,negative
1yuSWypzGewvhNZSwUlvPw,i don't understand what's the rave about this place let me start by saying to upon our entrance we were shocked to how ugly the place looksno ambiance whatsoever miserably decorated to no decor at all the chairs looks like they belong to a prison diner the food was way overpriced and some dishes were very disappointing oysters beef carpaccio was chewy instead of tender over all will never recommend to a friend for 200 tab i'll rather got somewhere well worth it give one star only for service,negative
0-M3vGd6IveJh77-Bwc8EQ,bad service close earlier than posted hours of thy feel like it been here an hour no ones bothered to offer to serve me had to go to the bar and basically stop waitress or stand in line at the bar glasses everywhere no drink order taken without effort if your business gets paid to make people wait and feel like a burden you'd get 5 stars,negative
m0xOsneAGX_5nIlxrLaN-w,i have mixed feelings about this place i had a good burger fries and some wings but man they really need to clean i can't go back until they do a major cleanse i mean seriously who has a sticky floor and just keeps it that way how can you stand to walk on it yourselves much less let your patrons walk on it the first time i went i thought someone had spilled something and gave them the benefit of the doubt nope second time back and it's all the same health department needs to close this place down until they can get their stuff in order also when your cook decides to come out and share his complete ignorance of how vaccines work during a global pandemic well it really doesn't make you want to eat his food,negative
8XbFkEQLu_R_rakkMlQgLA,great set of tvs and looks like it would be a great atmosphere for a game aside from their famous crab fries our food was terrible  fried fried and refried some more  we all took 34 bites of our dinner and had to stop  the service was friendlymaybe this is a great stop for catching a game drinking beer and eating wings but not so much for a dinner out with the family on a regular night,negative
2r8K64zBf81zBanmxniMkQ,boring caesar salad definitely bottled dressing the pan roast was served with the crab legs immersed in the sauce with meant if you wanted to eat them your hands were covered in sauce it was disgusting the steamed clams just tasted old,negative
wu2nJ5lW0tCU3VYa80i8Uw,we ordered from door dash and the order arrived 10 minutes faster than expected which is good both burgers were cold and did not appear or taste to be freshly prepared we are within a 78 minute drive one lacked any trace of tomatoes lettuce onions and pickles that are normally served with it the extra cheese ordered was melted but completely congealed and cold and also featured a  smooshed bun the onion strings were greasy and cold and did not appear or taste to be fresh even the tater tots were tasteless we have eaten here before and had a normal dining experience this was absolutely terrible no excuse for this i'll not eat there again,negative
rhS9NZKPpgL-Xrn6ihtfsA,this is probably the worst waffle house service was absolutely terrible our server was momma and she was so rude to us we wanted to play a few tunes and she kicked us off the touchtunes box my nephew really wanted to play a slaparooo and we were unable to i do not recommend this place to my worst enemy,negative
lzC5GKuP0haiIz7gOtvDFQ,this place doesn't earn deserve a star horrible service the waitress do not care for their job at all my friends  i came to watch the game and we asked to change the closest screen to us and she said its already requested by someone else okay fine but let me know why the 4 hours we were there the screen didnt change from the bdubs advertisement our food was cold and disgusting and ontop of that we got our bill split and when we got our credit card back she added 10 more still do not know why  thats before writingputting a tip this place needs help asap,negative

SDL247FlOnScJfuNjZESxg,this used to be one of my favorite restaurants for weeknight dinners or drinks i have been coming here for 5 years the food and service were once the most enjoyable in the city  and now you can expect overly salted dishes or dried out fish on their fish of the day night not to mention the horrendous service with slow unknowledgeable waitstaff and one of my biggest peeves they leave empty and dirty plates in front of you for way too long twenty manning is not what it used to be perhaps a change in management in the last year has allowed what was once a gem in the rittenhouse neighborhood to become a forgettable experience,negative
FxG4XkAbCzH4_mORu5TMkQ,we arrived on saturday evening  the restaurant really wasn't busy we were told 1520 min wait which seemed reasonable as we waited we watched as 3 different people several minutes apart told the hostess  manager that there was no toilet paper in the women's bathroom before it got addressed then after we had waited 20 minutes or so a waitress told the hostess that 3 tables were cleared  ready they only sat 1 table  we continued to wait another couple came in  requested take out  was given their order  we still hadn't been seated after waiting roughly 40 minutes knowing there were tables available we left  went to panera where we were seated  had our meal in 10 minutes had i actually gotten food i might be able to comment on how good it is but it will be awhile before we try this again,negative
nOtdiTtUD7gUieJGa3Q7mw,the staff is friendly but the management have brought up the prices 5 on this trying timei call it taking advantage of the current situationfoods nothing specialthey don't even have specials anymorei liked the steak and eggs special all gone with all the other specials,negative
cmdRgN41FdHv5o4426qTWw,i have been going to red lobsters at least twice a year for almost 20 years now this is the first time i ordered lobster never again for off season rex c our waitperson took at least 15 minutes to get back to our table every time we needed a refill or asked for something the guy only had 3 tables it was not a busy night  oh yeah and what's with the salad size less than a month ago we got red lobster in chico ca and the salad portions were double also he forgot our appetizer completely and the lobster was so chewey it was entirely dissapointing on top of that the lobster bisque well let's just say that safeway's is better  also we drove a bit over 100 miles round trip in pouring rain for this i hope corporate sees this i will be calling management tomorrow by the way i love red lobster this may change that,negative
bbs4FBchPGkWNgsVPLYIRw,horrible appetizer finally showed up right before entree 2 min steak i ordered  was medium came out well done service terrible now i know why i don't go to applebee's lucky i wasn't paying,negative
rl77SOSsmY-jklKpTm3jWw,i wish i could give 2 12 stars because i feel like public house epitomizes middleoftheroad dining some good some bad a lot of inbetweenthe decor  very cool space i love the high ceilings and columns of a former bank lobby very nice friendly dining environment the food  okay but not great the menu is not particularly imaginative but the food is prepared consistently i like that it's not trying to be something it's not more than unpretentious bar food but there is nothing on the menu that really stands out today i started with a cup of the soup a tomatobased chicken and vegetable that was actually pretty good but see below i also had a southwestern salad romaine onion cheese bacon cucumber and tomato with chopped turkey the turkey was diced lunch meat and maybe that shouldn't have surprised me but it was disappointing and less than impressive my companion ordered the nachos which were nachos they were okay probably would have been better 1 with some shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes and 2 without the 3 cup scoop of sour cream that seemed to coat every chip  i have previously had their burger which is above average and the sweet potato fries are passable but nothing you can't find on almost any bar menu these daysthe service  uneven at best i have eaten here several times and the waitstaff ranges from moderately uninterested to completely ignoring you our waitress today was upbeat and polite which was a promising start until my soup was served without a spoon and had gone cold by the time she reappeared for a busy restaurant i was surprised that i frequently couldn't see a single member of the waitstaff in the dining room then my salad came complete with the avocado i had asked to be left off this seems to be par for the course not the worst i've had but a lot of room for improvement would i return to public house yes but with considerably tempered expectations,negative
QPB8DUE_jAhgx1atM7sKBg,a group of us ate at mitchell's tonight  if things had been different i would have said dinedbut alaswe were seated quickly we had a reservation and then we waited and waited only a partial order for drinks was taken  and then we waited some more the rest of our party finally had their drink order taken45 minutes after being seated we placed our dinner orders  and then we waited and waitedthe food was cold and it's hard to say something tastes good when it's cold  so i'll just say the food was okay nothing specialrefills on water and tea were slowafter reading the reviews from people who dined there 2 nights ago it's hard to believe we ate at the same place they didwould we go back and give them another try  i'm not sure  there are other places where our money would be better spent,negative
gemjsCt1zOLCmRKjupcycQ,not impressed at all started with the cheese board which was completely uninspired the grapes were not fresh had seeds blackberries were mushy and flavorless the three types of cheese were disappointingly similar  i had the ravioli with shrimp for dinner although it was advertised as having a light pesto the sauce was very creamy and heavy completely over powering the dish the shrimp was very salty and barely cooked and almost seemed like it had been boiled  considering there were only 2 other tables occupied the entire time we were dining i'd say the word is out that this place is sub par,negative
njC9m9oY5s9uNghMp_fDnw,dianna was right on with her review in that the foyer stunk  i thought it was more toward the order of wet dog the whole place stunk like a kennel the eggs and hash browns were good the toast was sooooo dry and the bacon was not medium as i had requestedit was limp and fatty they at least offered to replace it with sausage which was barely ok i would go back but would rather enjoy a meal at a kennel because at least i can pet the dogs,negative
n5FS-R7aFxFSBeHfVCAuRQ,this place has great decor and i love the vibe the tater tot nachos were good  i'm not a fan of the chicken  i ordered the popeyei thought it was over cooked and i could taste the oil  i love brussel sprouts but these were bland and nothing nothing special the over the top bloody mary looked greatbut did not try it  overall not impressed and think there are better options on 12 south,negative
0aUlooXPSltR7-s7Wfsa6A,those drinks are all hype i decided to forgo the touristy cock cup and ordered a 32 oz to get more bang for my buck i didn't even get tipsy if you are looking to have a great giant slushee with a bunch of flavors to pick from then go for it but there was little to no alcohol which was quite disappointing,negative
iFgoIM21C_P68N8Dk-HHEA,i would give my experience at stella a c given the fact that i came without doing much homework on what to expext i didn't have expectations what i do expext in a restaurant is hot soup a proper utensil to eat it with i felt the menu was limited and the waiter inattentive  for just over 30000 for 2 people i walked away very disappointed,negative
C1F_T3S2JpoTy5p8-1zHlw,any restaurant that attempts to cook every type of cuisine is fooling themselves stick to one thing you're good at not a taste of the world my group literally ordered something different  ranging from asian stirfry to burgers to italian to perogies to steak none of which was good i guess i was eating at a different restaurant than everyone else heretake a look at their menu online  the entrees range from mom's meatloaf to chicken marsala to sizzlin' fajitas to miso glazed codwtf what kind of restaurant are you,negative
VKUafN1s-sxXhBmjvjdh7w,i was surprised with the quality of service my husband and i received last night it was sub par to say the least my server was davonne i ordered the quesadillas as an appetizer however it came out with my meal instead of as an appetizer i also ordered the crazy spicy skillet without mushrooms however it had mushrooms when i asked for it to be remade both he and the manager tammy tried to charge me for it i refused to pay for it as i did not eat the first order my husband ordered the grand slam with sausage and bacon but only received bacon davonne also forgot his side of toast i had an extra side of hasbrowms which were cold because he had let my food sit while waiting for the whole meal instead of bringing out the appetizer first so basically my meal was a waste of money then when i went to cash out and explain to tammy that it had come out incorrectly she told me the skillet does not come with mushrooms but davonne had to correct her so basically she acted as though i was lying even though my server could clearly see mushrooms on my plate it was a horrible experience,negative
vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g,wanted to try this restaurant before covid finally got a chance to go there the biggest disappointment is that their reservation app sucked and couldn't proceed after the selection i left a voicemail about the same no response or no call backs since it's covid time thought i can order  togo or delivery they hadn't specifically said no delivery for lunch but delivery is available website and yelpalso didn't claim there isn't a walkin either we drove for almost an hour and tried to get a seating for lunch they refused to let us in stating that reservations only even though there were empty seats  i did explain the issues with their app and the voicemail they simply didn't give any other option we literally drove back without tasting anything a restaurant can have rave reviews but if it's not customer focused i don't think it deserves even a tryvery disappointed and watch out for these ridiculous unfriendly service,negative
AZ42H2kk4JUiskC9NPoUjw,horrible  this place has horrible bartenders  the guy was rude  made us feel in comfortable  so many better options than this horrible bar,negative
7LvHXGCFhOXtOV_CT0PjnA,yuck sitting here eating my meal and looked and spotted a dead what appears to be a dead cockroach i asked to see the manager he came over  dcooped it into a plastic container and said it was a beetle i asked for a business card and he produced one with the name eric gm written on it  really thats it i pay full price for meal a while looking at dead insects and he doesn't offer any type of compensation for the experience totally unacceptable and rude dont spend your money here go somewhere where its clean and they appreciate your business just found out the manager's name is not ericits dan really,negative
qzCT_X5aTj8SkGpKdBYYdg,not too happy i got the spicy shrimp tacos one bite and i downed three mugs of water i couldn't eat them i'm usually fine with spicy foodwe got the carna asada fresh mex sandwich very little meat the second half had only two small strips of steak it was actually funny then we waited 20 mins for our bill not doing this again,negative
oHvEgLH6pAkcrPmeR1l3UQ,despite vowing not to return i did eat here with a friend just prior to a saturday night movie at the moolahwhile i would give the food a 4 star rating our service experience was less than desirablethis time i was seated promptly though my friend arrived 15 minutes later the waitress described the farmhouse burger as similar to steak and shake mixed up our side order refused to acknowledge her error and finallygrudgingly did not charge us i hope for her sake she has a job lined up someplace else  hopefully steak and shake ,negative
vYBCHqCPMzXKEqnAsLufNw,i've been to this steak n shake many times but wouldn't say it's ever really a wonderful experience yes it is cheap and yummy but also really greasy and dirty what else would you expect for a place where you can sit down to eat for less than you pay at mcdonald's my recent visit here just made me feel bad there was only one server for the entire place on a busy weekend lunch rush  and he looked beyond exhausted he was bussing tables taking orders delivering food running back to the cash register etc and sweating profusely i felt awful asking to get us the small things we needed i assume steak n shake must cut down on staffing expenses these days since they proudly boast 4 meals in 2017the food itself is not bad i have to admit i have a soft spot for a steakburger skinny fries and a huge handdipped milkshake i can't make this a frequent meal but every now and then it probably won't kill me,negative
vEdNsFx-ozYFNxR9XZQ5AA,my husband and i for the second time tried to have dinner at bar louie we were told just to sit anywhere by the bartender we choose a table and sat and sat 10 15 min not one person acknowledged us we decided to just have a drink and eat elsewhere so we moved to the bar again no one approached us we had to wave down a bartender who didn't seem very thrilled to serve us i ordered a dirty martini took a taste and there was no vodka in the drink i asked the bartender and he said he put vodka in it not hey sorry it's possible let me make you another at that point we just paid our bill and left we always tip and did so this time tooi have been a server in the past anyway the place stinks poor service and  a shame because it's a cute place,negative
USVks6B2Xkf0WLmLIiXqMA,after a long work trip out of town and an extensive yearning to visit this hungry cat i figured this would be the perfect time to break up the massive intake of steak my boyfriend had just taken in from the midwest with delicious fresh seafood it is known for the curiosity of dining at this cat has stemmed for some time between my extreme love of sea food and cats i have been clearly obsessed with the concept ever since we had planned on eating a large dinner here which we mutually agreed on seafood tier tower 1 to share the halibut for myself and the stuffed squid for him i did not even get through half of the seafood tower 1 before gagging in my napkin i almost threw up at the table the shrimp was very old after seeing the look on my face my boyfriend inquired why and immediately instructed the server which apologized and brought out two more shrimp to make up for it okay great i was happy and then took a swig of a raw oyster and then felt the same uneasiness and slimy oldness as the shrimp i put my fork down and decided i was done my boyfriend still starving and still open to the fact opened a second 'makeup shrimp'  and it was worse than the first  we decided to cancel dinner plans with the latter and agreed to go slices of pizza later if we came to be starving would be 100 fold better than risking the chance of food poisoning we graciously took the bill of an appetizer plus my 2 drinks that cost over 7500 and leftseeing the post of only 1 day ago agreeing that the shrimp is old before we even had a chance to review what others had said i would be extremely wary of the freshness of the sea food and would take it as a serious health precaution to avoid until this issue has been sorted out our poor server was great the quality of the ever amazing sounding seafood tower not so much we are both now laying in bed contemplating on where to get a couple slices of pizza taking bets on who will be in the bathroom first,negative
uB12vX5p9T8z0g2Eq3bBBQ,i've been to marigold a few times the first was not during a dining days event and we really thought it was fabulous the surprise of the 68 amuse bouche's was amazing we came back with friends last year during dining days and had a great experience the menu was comparable to what we had on a regular night and understandably they'd cut the amuse portions to about 4this year we came for dining days again with friends who'd never been and were totally disappointed terribly small menu barely sufficient service and just ok food no signature marigold amuse dishes even though we ordered off the a la carte menu and not the dining days the best part of the meal was the wine which we brought ourselves the worst part is our friends paid because of a bet we'd made long ago and i'm actually quite embarrassed to have taken them there even if they bring back the fun marigold flair outside of dining days our experience 72112 will be enough not to come back in the future,negative
5xW1QiUC2PEwa8jDha0scQ,i was completely not impressed with this place way over hyped i got a patty melt it was ok nothing special and neither were the fries my oreo milkshake was huge but again only ok it wasn't creamy and thick it was icy like it had too much milk will probably not return and spend my money at scoopers for better food and milkshakes,negative
GlUp8Ls2x2vToByiAtSnYw,this place left a menu at my doorstep a few weeks back  i was in the mood for a wrap during a football sunday and remembered that they offered wraps in addition to wingsi ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and a garlic parm wrap  although both items were prepared carefully i felt they were a bit off the mark  the wraps are made like chicken salad which means they have walnuts in them  the nuts just didn't seem to fit in a buffalo chicken wrap  the garlic parm wrap also had nuts in it and was lackluster too  simply put there really isn't anything to these wraps just lettuce chicken nuts mayo and whatever wing sauce you pick  locally the wraps at crazy bowls down the street are much better  i'll give them another try but next time will steer clear from the wraps and instead just go for the wings that they're most known for,negative
KFKzQpM3NtQAssAWFn9eLw,ordered a filet and this is what i got 23 dollars for the best cut of steak which consisted of mainly fat same thing with the new york strip but waaaay less acceptable for a filet manager was super rude over the phone and i heard her huff and say oh my god before putting me on hold said she put the order together herself and it looked perfect to them ha sad if this is what they consider perfect a waste of 50 won't be coming back even for the free meal she said i would receive in my email which i never got,negative
A8y3GLvov24ZvhrBlUk_hA,my review is mostly based on a situation we saw while dining we were near a large table of kids last friday that were not only loud and obnoxious but from what we could tell treated their server very poorly i over heard one kid call his server to the table by saying  hey ass holei don't know the full circumstances of this table however that is never called for the most aggravating part was that the manager came to the table and apologized instead of asking them to pay and leave this seemed like praising the kids and saying it's all the server or restaurants fault and that they the kids at the table should continue to treat others poorly we have eaten here numerous times the food is your typical inconsistent kitchen sometimes good others not so much never great however the servers have all ways been nice and attentive after seeing how poorly managed this place is we wont be back,negative
EUu9FqaXxIwhRxLgEJ6WiQ,this place is trash everytime we go in this i have a poor experience wait staff is slow except for one waiter who's name i dont know he has dreadlocks and is super nice and is on top of everything it's like pulling teeth to get a refill today i went in and i'm looking at about 10 to 15 open tables we get told it was a 10 minute wait after that the lobby fills up and we wait about 15 mins the people who came after us started to get sat so when we asked the host she asked for a name well no one ever asked us our name just how many and told us 10mins so my experience started bad after that our waiter asked us for our drinks we placed our drink orders and some how he messed it up and brought out the wrong drinks and to many drinks it was a table of 4 why would he bring 5 drinks  the dreadlock waiter brought out our food and it was perfect food was fine but refills took forever and clearing the table of our dirty app plates took forever i work in the industry and almost always tip at least 25 thus restaurant is the only place i've ever tipped under 10 and not felt bad i tried to chase the guy with the dreads down in the parking lot but i guess he had headphones in and couldn't hear me i was gonna give him 20 just for being the best server in there sorry for the bad yelp but you guys gotta fix the wait staff,negative
QzOH5gO0LuUkvDbr3u3ktQ,been here a few times i don't know why i'm being generous  giving 2 stars but the waiter was nice  location super convenient since some of us were meeting after our movies the last couple times the food was mediocre biggest downfall  everything was dirty  the floors were sticky everywhere but especially in the bathroom our feet were seriously sticking to the floors eww our wines glasses  2 of us ordered wine  dirty you could feel it on the outside  visibly dirty we washed  the area we would be drinking from before putting it to our mouths in hindsight probably should've asked for another but it took us so long to get our drinks guess we were anxious  the plates at the salad bar  dirty i went through the small piles that were left every single one had to be wiped off before you could use it the salad bar  dirty  a mess needed to be cleaned up  wiped down desperately also so many of the selections were bottom of the barrel just floating in ice  needed to be freshened up it was 530 on a sunday  pretty busy so a time when things should've been stocked very disappointed this is in a perfect location for us especially being regular moviegoers  i love a good salad bar but after this experience i wouldn't recommend coming here hopefully things improve please step it up ,negative

9kv9JpLhzkN3UeWZDrsmEA,we aren't from the city but looked up places to go we had planned to go to a place down the street  which we did and was amazing for dinner and then walk to the country club afterwards for a drink because online it looked beautifulafter walking 15 minutes and finding the country club we were greeted with questions about our intentions mainly whether we were going to the pool or not we had planned on having dessert and a cocktail here forgoing the previous bar of a sweet treat because of our planswe didn't know how to answer our intentions as we hadn't been here before i really wanted to have a drink and have something sweet to eat outside so i explained that we were told we couldn't walk outside past their security and those doors without forking up 10 a pop to go outside i explained in was confused and thought the 10 cover was to swim and was told i was mistaken but that it was to walk through those doors rightso trying to make the most of it my boyfriend and i were glancing over the menu for cocktails when the bartender asked us to give him our menu to give to someone else he told us we didn't look serious and took our menu to hand off and then mentioned oh the kitchen is closed you can't order dessert anyways i asked why and he said it was 9pm we entered at 830 he could have easily told us the circumstances but obviously did not care this whole thing felt very you aren't from here please go away it's was so oddi don't usually leave reviews except for one's noting how bad the whole experience was this was bad rude pretencious just bad get your stuff together because this was so not oh k for a couple researching and looking forward to a place on vacation tsk tsk,negative
piwQeOk72AM3_RMqwuk0VA,very disappointed with our attempted lunch today  promptly seated but then completely ignored by the staff and the manager who looked at us twice before walking a different direction  after 10 minutes of waiting and no service we left  'lunch express' became lunch frustration and a warning to choose the many other options in the area next time,negative
Lw1gzZZGI2GFQc6BI5zyJw,nothing to specifically complain about just not really a fan of this placethe food was decent from what i remember problem is i was there yesterday yesterday and i can't even freaking remember what i had or if it was any good  translation this place serves unmemorable ordinary fare  which is almost the worst kind reallyin times of headoverheels food coma love i remember everything  from the way the different flavors mingled on my palate to the heartwrenching realization of the final bite but here the experience is all just a blurred forktomouth episode of mediocrity  reinforced by a lack of anything inspiring  ambiance meh service meh food quality mehconvenience is probably the only reason i'll ever come back here or maybe just for some drinks when the weather turns again the outdoor seating is nice and plentiful,negative
Pr6evSEG2vmtS8ny7K4nVA,i booked this reservation a few weeks ago for my 25th birthday i saw this restaurant all over the internet and was so excited to come when i arrived it wasn't the friendliest welcome but we were sat promptly we proceeded to wait 20 mins for a server to come up to us when she finally did we gave her our whole order another person came over another 15 mins later with water and told us it'll be a few for the drinks after waiting another 20 mins we stopped a staff member and asked us if there was anything she could do to bring food or some of our drinks another 10 mins later we got 4 out of 5 of drinks then our waitresses proceeded to come over reintroduced herself and asked if we wanted to place our order after we did almost an hour ago we ended up just walking out the staff was friendly just really stressed and couldn't keep up unfortunately this ruined mybirthday dinneri was looking forward to this for almost a month i hope this email helps you fix some of these issues,negative
2kibWJ1TXySaKhkQia23Qw,summary once upon a time tgif was something i looked forward to not so much and was reminded why on a recent visit background was on a business trip and the boss wanted to go here foodcan't remember what i ordered exactly but it was a chixshrimp with cheese with mashed potato  veggie type dish when i got it i surmised that the shrimp didn't die from the heat of the platter but rather the amount of oil that the chef decided to use on my meal maybe some of it came from the cheese too but what matter was that the dish was drowning in oil literally i had to put a napkin under one side of the platter to get the oil out of the food 25service typical tgif meaning passable return visitnot unless the boss makes the decision,negative
hgbSjUZ9J4yauE_v6nuIyg,the food here is excellent but the service is enough to make you run out the door it feels like the owners are just maintaining and the snotty careless attitude of the staff is disappointing,negative
P5Wq5OwEJ0Zz7piLoToXDA,i will never return to this location i realize that this location is located right next to usf so there will be lots of college kids but i never expected to walk in and not be able to hear a damn thing due to a dj blasting music i was staying in a nearby hotel and needed something to eat my choices were limited at 10 pm at night and i didn't was fast food the staff was quite rude when we asked for a table outside i'm hard of hearing and i'd rather not lose anymore hearing from that loud music plus my boyfriend couldn't even hear a word i said,negative
HCEriqmu3eKkNaUkMx67lQ,i've tried grain twice since they have opened a few weeks ago my coworkers and i work down the street so we were hoping to find a place with a good happy hour they do have a decent happy hour with a couple dollars off drafts and well drinks and certain appetizers are discounted unfortunately that is where the good part of the review ends both times i was there the service was friendly enough but annoyingly slow even though they had tons of staff on and it wasn't that busythe most disappointing thing was the food everything that we ordered was lacking flavor and nothing came out hot enough the food that we tried were the fried pickles not hot and the batter had no seasoning the nachos the cheese was cold from the moment we got it the beer cheese dip very weird flavor and was served in a goblet such a weird choice and the bacon wrapped shrimp no complaints with this one it was pretty good overall disappointing experience and would only return for a drink the food is definitely not worth the price,negative

TJ3rnd66ErA9mbrXf396ig,the talent was great tonight however the servers suck  we would have stayed a very long time but we got tired of having to get beers from the bartender if you want to listen to good music this place has it if you want to drink beer eat or anything elsego somewhere else they suck for service here,negative
bN_9QgxdOIk4oK-6fBDJtQ,so overrated overpriced 800 for orange juice without vodka and horrible service  i can not believe that i waited 45 minutes for all that  the host a man was horrible with a bad attitude  i get it everyone has bad days i excuse that once but i have encountered him with that attitude on numerous occasions  i excused honey's numerous times and kept giving them more chances but it never improved  sorry no more honey's it's really not worth it  i honestly believe it's so busy because it is the only place to get a homestyle breakfast  altough i will say there is one young lady that works an occasional night i believe she is from the suburbs and she is very nice that is the only good review honey's will get from me,negative
0yEl45kZ8o37lvpkhCBM4w,three shots of tequila and two beers in happy hour it was 5250 dlls    seriously overpriced,negative
8ASzjS3ITg5bQSyObsCx5w,i'm bummed to have to rewrite my review of russells i think my best experiences have certainly been at breakfast my husband and i came to dinner on a thursday night we ordered an onion mum soup and the daily special panned chicken with monica sauce and mac and cheese the onion mum had some parts that were super burnt and some that were mushy and underdone but we ate a good bit of it the sauce was delicious we each ordered the special my husbands chicken  was thick and juicy mine was so thin you could barely see the chicken just batter and was overfried to the point of the ends were too harddry to eat the sauce on it was the biggest issue though it tasted super seafoody and just off i scraped it off as much as i could my husband ate it the next day we both had stomach issues and wondered if it was from that the mac and cheese was excellent though overall unless its breakfast i probably wouldn't come back,negative
-Tskf8WK17rb3ZfeFuRSWA,so i broke many rules eating here but if further confirmed why i have these rules1 avoid the big corporate family restaurants when you are from out of town2 use caution if you call to get a reservation on a weekend  they say just come on inmy excuse we were almost going to order room service from our hotel but decided to walk across the street instead  you know it's pretty bad when you prolly would have had a better meal in the hotel room  one star for the location and a glimpse of the table side bananas foster from the table next to us  service  dinner was honestly less than 1 star  i can not even remember the last time i ever wanted to tip less than 15 spinach salad was less than fresh  over dressed  pecan crusted fish was so overly prepared it made me think that they have to mask the not so fresh fish with all the sauce,negative
VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,we waited in line for about 10 min then got seated our waitress was very friendly and promptly gave us water and took our orders my friend and i waited at least 3545 min for our food i think she forgot to put our order in because she checked on us after 20 minutes and another 15 minutes or so to check our order our food finally came and it was not worth the wait at all it was the worst oyster rockefeller i've ever had the shrimp in the po'boy was good but the sandwich was so dry it was our first night and meal in nola and we unfortunately had this experience do not go here,negative
_nqrmx5xKLQyrbmjhwiiuA,hey yelp  why no zero or negative star ratings for restaurants like this  a pretentious start with restricted elevator access as if any one of sound mind and body would want to jump the vip line into this disaster  unfortunately the elevator was working and we made it to the second floor where we entered into a pitch black foyer with blue led light show on the floor  really  why  we were looking forward to our dining experience  great seating around the chefs prep area  our first encounter was with the sommelier who reprimanded us  as if we didn't know that white burgundy is french chardonnay  she was very arrogant and  had a condescending attitudeone of my guests had specific dietary requirements which they went over with her when we wear seated  only one person of the four requested alternate menu items  the manager took it upon herself to foist her restrictions on our entire party  they substituted  the veal cheek to kobe beef for everyone and it was fatty and gristly   what quality was the kobea1 when i mentioned that we couldn't chew or cut it and might i have a different slice the manager came by and said they had no more the salty seminal cod fluid was also a disappointment   and i've had my share of seminal fluid     the entire dining experience was so disappointing especially the arrogant sommelier and the attitude of the manager who at one point someone suggested she was the chef i'm ok with the food not being to my liking but the attitude of 2 people in particular ruined the night      the music and the water service were above average   enjoy,negative
-lX4ufgPLYubI8rVxNM31w,food is mediocre fish overcooked seasoning somewhat bland edible for sure not awful just not goodservice super slow even after the room was mostly empty inflexibility in dividing checks between multiple cardsplusses the staff is friendly and kindwhen they can be found pandemic serving is tough lots of places are short staffed but this seemed extreme,negative
UK007MpAU5B6P4o7_dVsTA,owner was quite rude to us including seating a party that came in after us at the last available table and then telling us we'd have to wait another 25 minutes definitely will not be coming back,negative
3ckr3dOeYW1m1yXsNwesrg,went here for a quick quiet breakfast on the way home from work one morning it was probably not the best idea i've ever had there was a table of about 78 men seated right in the center of the tiny dining room who were shouting and yelling so loud i could not even talk to my companion the staff seemed to think it was totally cool that they had to shout over these buttheads just to get other people's orders on top of that when our food got to the table mine was under cooked the server literally took my plate to the kitchen removed the undercooked portion and returned with the rest it was like hey i know you want to eat half of you meal frigid and the other half warm and oh you actually wanted to eat at the same time as your party too bad after all of that and not eating because i was so mad i had to pay a nearly 50 tab for two people and i did not even have a meal most places would have at least comped the messed up meal that ended up in a doggiebag skip this location maybe another is better if you're actually looking for a serverrestaurant who wants to retain new customersbtw don't eat the butter sitting uncooled on the tables that clearly states on the packaging must be refridgerated  unless you like spending hours in the bathroom from spoiled food,negative
cOXc8c85Ms6dMEAJazLXHQ,very loud and crowded the lighting was so poor you couldn't even read the menu which had a very limited selection,negative
KFKzQpM3NtQAssAWFn9eLw,went for lunch got the new shaved prime rib sandwhich very dry and bland meat was flavorless and overcooked the best part of my meal was the coke zero,negative
AIz-s8l_vXHOOyjiykYehw,2nd visit 1st bad experience but it was my very first togo order as well so that might have made a difference due to food allergies i had to order cheeses sauce types  dressings on side of my salad  tacos as well as the flatbread as we checked one order in a bag and saw cheese covering the dish we asked if it could be remade the guy apologized and said no prob gave us 2 virgin pinacoladas while we waited then out comes the second order in its own bag as well i'm hungry so i open the dish to munch on while wait for the other to come back and wouldn't u know it sauce drenched over my tacos again the gentleman knew the mistake being he took the entire order over the phone he was embarrassed and again took back my order to fix so that was awesome on his part but not his fault to takeby the time we get all 3 orders head up to our room the beautiful salad was without any type of salad dressing on the side or on top or anywhere  i was so upset so upset i will not return nor will i recommend this place again there are plenty of the same types of places all up our tampa bay gulf beaches  bummer bongos i'm disappointed that i chose to spend my birthday with you,negative
VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,we visited on a friday around lunch time looking to try some po boys while in town searching through yelp i saw royal house had 4 stars and over 3000 reviews we were seated quickly with no wait and our server came over soon after our service was good our waiter was lively and they accommodated our request to move tables once some friends came to meet us however our food was pretty mediocre i ordered the shrimp po boy and it was not very good the fried shrimp didn't taste fresh and i had to slather on copious amounts of chipotle mayo to choke it down the french fries were decent though this was our least favorite meal during our stay in new orleans,negative
TwnzM8mJn_nT2PJf1x-9kQ,i try not to be that person who writes a review about a restaurant which has nothing to do with the food but i came here with three people and was given an estimated wait time of 40 minutes which in itself isn't a big deal especially at a brunch place on a saturday at 11 am however the thing that annoyed me was the three empty tables we were staring at for 10 minutes until we decided to leavethis place doesn't take reservations and supposedly doesn't have a waitlist of some kind so who were those tables for  i've been to tons of brunch places and never saw just empty tables while waiting it's ridiculous if you are saving seats for someone during brunch rush that's rude to your waiting customers and if you're keeping tables empty because you don't have the staff remove the tables from the room don't force people to stare at them while waiting to be seated after the 10 minutes we decided to leave and go to the down home diner instead which was half the price and just as good if not better this place has decent food and i dream about their lemon ricotta pancakes but i don't need to be forced to wait when there are empty tables right in front of me,negative
kvle5j_7tlzX5-vRXjWUGw,we have been patronizing this business since they opened and made it one of our regular stops food has really gone downhill in the last 6 months  today was the final straw  i ordered seared cod which i've had probably a half a dozen times or more since this place has opened  this is what i got  i asked to speak to the manager and she proceeded to tell me the kitchen dusts the cod with cornstarch prior to searing it this had thick hard breading  the manager offered to replace it with baked cod i don't want baked cod and the cod has never looked like this why can't they just make it correctly all i can say is this was awful and the quality of the food is quickly declining  the manager is also a rude wench our waiter was good  the food sucked and management is awful,negative
s3E_OAafutZHslDkkMnDQA,had the doc holliday special 2 of the thinnest lightest  7 oz pork chops possible which were cooked to the consistency of shoe leather sent back and got slightly better chops  this is high school cafeteria food at  mid range restaurant prices the live country music had not started so maybe that's worth a trip because what i had to eat sure isn't,negative
Fca-iOgKaIKTaN7ikUgWDQ,there aren't a whole lot of choices particularly if you try to keep it healthy  i ordered a catfish po boy and was disappointed  there was more breading than fish and the po boy topping was simply diced tomatoes with a bit of sauce  the fries were tasty and it's worth mentioning that my colleague was pleased with his burger,negative
XH8H630zdwkFANePYmmXqQ,here now there is a 1015 minute wait even though half of the tables are empty all because they don't have enough servers so  the customers have to suffer because this restaurant doesn't know how to staff their establishment never coming back if this is what we have to endure ridiculous,negative
T9nNz9-3mfNga0T0Nfzvsw,worst meal my husband and grandson ever had the clams casino was off and they took it off the bill when has a 17 yr old ever not finished a cheesesteaks we have eaten there over the years but something is now wrong in the kitchen,negative
Y_kXztsFC7l0mMQAYXNkNA,horrible menu over priced bad service they won't even give you a dinner roll rotten tomato in salad   i have eaten at z grill twice both times very disappointing  the last time was with a friend i ordered a steak  it was the worst steak that i have ever had  it was totally un edible  it was one big blob of fat i could not even get one single bite of steak from this nasty piece of fat when the waiter came over to see how our meals were i explained to him the problem  he said that was normal he could put it back on the grill but that was all he was willing to do  he sends over the manager who looked at me like i was crazy when i explained  when it was time to leave it was still on the bill  i feel like they stole 80 from my wallet and replaced it with a big fat nasty piece of fat  do yourself a favor go somewhere else to eat,negative
mS-ZtRREi7rhTL5Cg8VEvg,online menu could not be worse hubby who got there repeated everything they didnot have like the eggrolls and spinach salad and chicken wrap likesorry why stay in business  so very sad,negative
033Ok264muClFlaWFeqo9g,heard great things so i had to check it out with friends made a 12pm reservation for sunday brunch stood in line for the buffet food was ok had to wait for mimosas and had to hunt down a server when we needed refills asked for a manager 3 times because we didn't receive our pancakes waffles and french toast,negative
YZ0YVMdWUik8ukQp1CILtg,terrible customer service i wish i could give them 0 stars they messed up the order they knew that they messed up the order when we called them back but refused to make amends we asked for a new sandwich or a refund for the sandwich or a store credit they refused all the options they wanted us to go back to the restaurant and swap the sandwich when it was clearly their mistake would not recommend this place to anyone,negative
a32M9H9nkkPGKTKB5W27NA,this place needs to be shut down and put out of business for goodgross and overated do not eat here,negative
4xNBm3oGqSryXvvl2X3TuQ,food on the buffet was so subpar salad was overdressed i've never seen spicy tuna roll be made by dumping red pepper flakes on it desserts were hit and miss heard others complaining about dry salmon  cod was blah prime rib and lobster bisque were fine we didn't do the crab leg add on for 10 but it looked like several people did more importantly the atmosphere is not of a nice restaurant with the beach resort outside you can hear the music while your eating the beach view is blocked by those partying outside they don't stop beach goers from walking through saw several people come through in their bikinis and a guy barefoot they also come in to use the same restroom so it was a mess littered w beer bottles and such i was originally considering 2 stars until both my husband and i got sick all night from the food so that's a waste of a 70 meal,negative
kpl3H_sgfTm-tH3Aa-ML7g,always fond of here but working late hours i always appreciated late hours and was sad the chance to early hours,negative
llLvHJgkKQNfzgtKf6p3BQ,rude people working there called in an order and the idiot was too lazy to give me different types of wings they offer  wtf  he hung up on me and i had to call back and say 'i think you hung up on me he said 'how can i help you  i said i asked you what type of wings you have and you hung up on me he said you can find them on the website who are these people  my buddy hates going in there they have great wings but he is sick of the rudeness coming from the straggly beards and man bun hair my friend said this has been going on for about a year now owners need to make a few changes   the best wings in pinellas county can only carry you so far,negative
Ah2gjiO-HArE2VPGiMKeiA,most nights i would give this location more than 1 star but tonight they earned their star  for a monday night all you can eat wing night this place is dead which you would believe to be a good thing but you're wrong it took 45 minutes to get our order of 20 wings to our table once they did get here our order was wrong go figure the waitress didn't ask if she could refill our drinks or get us anything else while we waited she only noticed i wanted more to drink when i made a comment to my friend  pointed to my empty cup  it then took an additional 18 minutes to bring us the correct order  sad to say i'll be back but i won't be expecting much  you shouldn't either,negative
